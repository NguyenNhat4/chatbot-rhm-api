what is the nature of the protective reflex that stops chewing?,"the nerve endings in the temporomandibular joints and the masticatory muscles also send impulses to the special proprioceptor nucleus in the mid-brain and from there to the motor nucleus of the muscles of mastication. with the increased power demands of various foods more frequent and numerous impulses arrive at the motor nucleus from the periodontal membranes, temporomandibular joints and the musculature. this increased tempo of signals results in a crescendo of muscular effort sufficient to overcome the food resistance or until occlusal contact is obtained. until occlusal contact is obtained. the protective nature of this entire system has been experienced by all of us. if in chewing, we accidentally strike the tongue or a piece of bone in our food, we are immediately surprised with the rapid cessation of chewing and reversal of the closing movement. it was not pain that caused the muscles the tongue or a piece of bone in our and reversal of the closing movement. it was not pain that caused the muscles to relax for we are not aware of it until a few milliseconds after we have stopped chewing. what did stop our chewing was a protective reflex primarily tactile and proprioceptive in nature. this, of course, is an unusual example of oral proprioception being brought to a conscious level. this special aspect of nervous function is continually active at a reflex level. the presence of ill-fitting restorations, whether operative or prosthetic, are man-made irritants and stimulants to a proprioceptive response. the occurrence of malpositioned teeth before and after orthodontic treatment is also a factor initiating altered functional patterns and protective reflexes.","{'answer_start': [1162], 'text': ['primarily tactile and proprioceptive']}",,clinical,"{'authors': ['Harold T.

"in growing class ii patients with mandibular retrusion treated with the bionator appliance, what is the effect of the appliance when used at the peak of the pubertal growth spurt?","the findings of the present study indicate clearly that significant long-term changes in the occlusal relationships and mandibular growth increments can be achieved by bionator therapy only when functional treatment includes the pubertal growth spurt. according to the new cvm method, these data indicate that functional jaw orthopedics with the bionator should start not earlier than cvms ii (when a concavity is evident at the lower borders of both the second and third cervical vertebrae). in the long term, the late-treated subjects, who started bionator treatment at the growth spurt, showed a significant improvement in the overjet ( 4.2 mm) and a favorable change in the molar relation ( 2.1 mm). the amount of supplementary elongation of the mandible in the ltg when compared with corresponding controls (5.1 mm) was two and a half times that of the etg (1.9 mm), and it was produced almost entirely by bionator therapy. posttreatment changes were not significant. the greater increase in total mandibular length (co-pg) was associated with significant supplementary increases in the height of the mandibular ramus (co-go, 4.8 mm) in the group treated at the peak when compared with the corresponding control group, whereas only a 0.5-mm change for this measurement was recorded in the etg. these results have significance not only at the statistical level but also are relevant clinically.","{'answer_start': [977], 'text': ['greater increase in total mandibular length (co-pg) was associated with significant supplementary increases in the height of the mandibular ramus']}",,clinical,"{'authors': ['Kurt Faltin, Jr, DDS, PhD', 'Rolf M.

what is the mode of inheritance of achondroplasia?,"dwarfism occurs in about in in 1 in 26,000 individuals. achondroplasia is the most common form of dwarfism, and about 90% of cases are caused by new mutation. it is an autosomal dominant trait that affects males and females equally. recent biochemical investigations indicate that the congenital defect factor receptor fgfr is responsible for achondroplasia. it appears that recurrent mutations of a single amino acid in the transmembrane domain of the fgfr protein is the culprit. manifestations of achondroplasia include short stature and craniofacial malformations, including a short cranial base with early spheno-occipital closure and megalocephaly. failure of normal cartilage proliferation leads not only to characteristically short arms and legs, but also to underdevelopment of the midface because the upper jaw is not translated forward by normal lengthening of the cranial base. cephalometric characteristics of achondroplasia include an enlarged calvaria with hydrocephaly and frontal bossing, short posterior cranial base, retrognathic maxilla, normal mandible, and protrusive maxillary incisors. the patient in this report had maxillary skeletal retrognathia and severe maxillary dental protrusion. this case was treated orthodontically and has remained stable during a 2-year retention period. the patient, a 10-year-old japanese girl with achondroplasia, was 109 cm tall at the initial visit. she was diagnosed as achondroplastic at birth and had been receiving growth hormone treatment three times per day for 2 years at the department of pediatrics, tokushima university medical hospital. her chief complaint was maxillary protrusion. she had a history of tongue thrusting and lower lip biting. her dental history was unremarkable, and she appeared to be well adjusted, healthy, and intelligent. typical of achondroplasia, the patient exhibited a concave soft-tissue profile with a bulging forehead and a retrognathic maxilla. the nose was saddle-shaped because of lack of development of the nasomaxillary complex. there were no apparent major asymmetries, judging from both lateral and frontal photographs. the maxillary incisors were protrusive, causing the upper lip to protrude (figure 1a-c).","{'answer_start': [159], 'text': ['it is an autosomal dominant trait']}",,pathology,"{'authors': ['Tomoko Ohba, DDS', 'Yasuo Ohba, DDS, PhD', 'Satoru Tenshin, DDS, PhD', 'Teruko Takano-Yamamoto, DDS, PhD'], 'doi': 'https://doi.org/10.1043/0003-3219(1998)068<0377:OTOCID>2.3.CO;2', 'meta': 'Angle Orthod (1998) 68 (4): 377–382.', 'title': 'Orthodontic treatment of Class II Division 1 malocclusion in a patient with achondroplasia'}",bc1f9640-0d75-4124-b85f-d903c9cc1f07
"in horizontal tooth movement, what type of force delivery method is more effective between continuous and interrupted continuous?","the aim of the present clinical investigation was to assess the effects of continuous and interrupted continuous forces of the same magnitude (50 cn~ 50 g) on orthodontic tooth movement and related adverse tissue reactions, i.e., root resorption. thirty-two maxillary first premolars in 16 patients, 8 boys and 8 girls (mean age 13.9 years), were moved buccally by means of a fixed orthodontic appliance with a sectional arch. the patients were divided into two groups of 8, for experimental periods of 4 and 7 weeks. the continuous force was checked and reactivated weekly to 50 cn. the interrupted continuous force applied to the contralateral premolars was left uncontrolled for 3 weeks, after which the arch was made passive for 1 week for tissue rest and recovery. tooth movements were studied on dental casts using a coordinate measuring machine (validator 100, tesa sa, renens, switzerland). horizontal tooth movement with continuous force was more effective than with interrupted continuous force after 7 weeks. histological sections of the experimental teeth, however, showed no in the amount or severity of root resorption between the two forces. individual variations in both the magnitude of tooth movement and the amount and severity of root resorption for both of the two force systems were great.","{'answer_start': [930], 'text': ['continuous force was more effective than with interrupted continuous force']}",,biology,"{'authors': ['Py Owman-Moll, DDS, Odont Dr', 'Jüri Kurol, DDS, Odont Dr', 'Dan Lundgren, DDS, Odont Dr'], 'doi': 'https://doi.org/10.1043/0003-3219(1995)065<0395:CVICOF>2.0.CO;2', 'meta': 'Angle Orthod (1995) 65 (6): 395–401.', 'title': 'Continuous versus interrupted continuous orthodontic force related to early tooth movement and root resorption'}",3b3bce56-bfce-451b-8781-279084c63281
"regarding hypersensitivity to materials, which metals can cause an allergic reaction?","in general, a small amount of metal can cause metal allergies in daily life. mercury, nickel, chromium, cobalt, copper, tin, gold, platinum, palladium, antimony, silver, iron, zinc, cadmium, and manganese all have been shown to be causative agents of metallic allergy. metal allergic diseases thought to be related to dental metals have recently become a serious problem. in this case, allergic hypersensitivity in the form of lip swelling and redness was induced after orthognathic surgery. in clinical cases, allergic contact hypersensitivity to nickel develops much more readily in inflamed skin than in normal skin. in this way, sensitization to nickel develops much more easily in the presence of strong inflammation. at the inflammation site, reactive oxygen species such as hydrogen peroxide (h2o2) and hypochlorite (ocl )4 are produced by phagocytes. in the case of nickel hypersensitivity, these powerful oxidants can oxidize ni2+ to the higher oxidation states of ni3+ and ni4+, respectively,19 which have a far greater chemical reactivity than ni2+. it has also been reported that sensitization is achieved by injecting ni2+ or by administering nickel as ni3+ and ni4+. the results showed that ni3+ and ni4+, but not ni2+ alone, were able to sensitize native t cells. these findings might explain why hypersensitivity against nickel in humans develops much more easily in inflamed skin than in normal skin, since both ni3+ and ni4+ can be generated from ni2+ by reactive oxygen species released during inflammation. in fact, we previously established a nickel-hypersensitized animal model by injecting nickel at the inflammation site. cr4+ species are strong oxidants that act as carcinogens, mutagens, and teratogens in biological systems. the high solubility, bioavailability, and toxicity of cr4+ make it a particular environmental concern. in contrast, cr3+ species have low toxicity, in part because their bioavailability is limited by their low solubility and their tendency to form strong complexes with organics and hydroxo complexes. higher chromium oxidation states also possess a far greater chemical reactivity.","{'answer_start': [77], 'text': ['mercury, nickel, chromium, cobalt, copper, tin, gold, platinum, palladium, antimony, silver, iron, zinc, cadmium, and manganese']}",,materials,"{'authors': ['Hideki Kitaura', 'Yuji Fujimura', 'Noriko Nakao', 'Toshiko Eguchi', 'Noriaki Yoshida'], 'doi': 'https://doi.org/10.2319/082306-344', 'meta': 'Angle Orthod (2007) 77 (5): 923–930.', 'title': 'Treatment of a Patient with Metal Hypersensitivity after Orthognathic Surgery'}",db8fd954-5bfd-4a4c-92e7-8925e5acdc7b
"in children, when does a thumb sucking habit usually stop?","postretention evaluation five years after the completion of the active treatment the cephalometric superimposition (fig. ure 12) and intraoral photos (figure 13a-c) showed minimal postretention changes. the overjet and overbite were slightly improved postretention and the intercuspation had also improved. mild crowding had developed in the mandibular anterior areas. when studied from the psychological aspect persistent finger-sucking habits may be related to hunger, a need to satisfy a natural sucking instinct, insecurity or even a desire to attract attention. most finger-sucking habits usually stop by age 3 or 4 with no influence on the permanent dentition and are generally not dealt with as a separate problem in orthodontic treatment. if, however, the habit continues until the permanent incisors erupt, then the finger-sucking habit may be a direct cause of open bite. the most common dental consequence is for the thumb to push the maxillary incisors labially and the mandibular incisors lingually. the habit also causes a narrowing of the maxillary arch and maxillary dentoalveolar or skeletal protrusion. however, this patient had a severe deep overbite, which may have been influenced by the loss of posterior dental support from premature loss of primary teeth, or more likely from forward mandibular rotation during growth. the decision was made not to use any appliances to prevent the thumb-sucking habit because the patient years old and had expressed of the consequences of his habit as well as a willingness to attempt to control it. elimination of the thumb-sucking habit was accomplished within weeks after the start of the motivational therapy. patients who present with maxillary protrusion can be classfied as having dentoalveolar or skeletal components or a combination of the two. early treatment is frequently recommended to correct intermaxillary skeletal and dentoalveolar relationships by placing a distal force on the maxilla, typically with a headgear. in this case, cervical headgear and a maxillary biteplate were used in combination as initial appliances. the goal was to correct the maxillary protrusion with the distal force placed by the headgear on the maxillary first molars. cephalometric analysis (figure 4) indicated that forward maxillary growth was restrained. the bite plate had the effect of allowing free eruption of the posterior teeth, thereby decreasing the overbite. this also allowed the mandible to escape the confining effect of the deep overbite.","{'answer_start': [567], 'text': ['most finger-sucking habits usually stop by age 3 or 4']}",,growth,"{'authors': ['Shigemi Goto, DDS, PhD', 'Robert L.

how many syndromes are associated with supernumerary teeth?,"supernumerary teeth may be defined as any teeth or tooth substance in excess of the usual configuration of 20 deciduous and 32 permanent teeth. supernumerary teeth may occur singly, multiply, unilaterally, or bilaterally and in one or both jaws. they occur more frequently in males. rajab and hamdan reported in their study that males were more affected than were females, the sex ratio being 2.2:1. mitchell reported a 2:1 ratio in favor of males. hongstrum and andersson and brook also reported a 2:1 ratio of sex distribution, whereas luten found a sex distribution of 1.3:1. the most common supernumerary teeth, listed in order of frequency, are the maxilla midline supernumeraries, maxillary fourth molars, maxillary paramolars, mandibular premolars, maxillary lateral incisors, mandibular fourth molars, and maxillary premolars. over 20 syndromes and developmental conditions have been found to be associated with single supernumerary teeth and multiple supernumerary teeth developing as part of systemic conditions such as cleidocranial dysplasia, gardners syndrome, and cleft lip and palate. the occurrence of multiple supernumerary teeth without any associated systemic conditions or syndromes, however, is a rare phenomenon. single supernumeraries occur in 76 86% of cases, double supernumeraries in 12 23% of cases, and multiple supernumeraries in less than 1% of cases. although multiple supernumerary teeth without associated syndromes are rare, their occurrence can create a variety of clinical problems such as crowding, delayed eruption, diastema, rotations, cystic lesions, and resorption of the adjacent teeth. hence, suitable treatment after proper clinical and radiographic evaluation is essential. the aim of this report is to document two rare cases of familial occurrence of multiple supernumerary teeth occurring as an isolated nonsyndromic trait and to discuss the treatment modalities.","{'answer_start': [835], 'text': ['over 20 syndromes and developmental conditions']}",,pathology,"{'authors': ['Ayşe Işıl Orhan', 'Levent Özer', 'Kaan Orhan'], 'doi': 'https://doi.org/10.1043/0003-3219(2006)076[0891:FOONMS]2.0.CO;2', 'meta': 'Angle Orthod (2006) 76 (5): 891–897.', 'title': 'Familial Occurrence of Nonsyndromal Multiple Supernumerary Teeth: A Rare Condition'}",59c261aa-dffb-4a6d-a115-5ed0540b0b4d
what are the clinical manifestations of osteochondroma of the mandibular condyle?,"many explanations have been offered as to the cause of asymmetries, including genetic imperfections in the mechanism which was meant to create symmetry, and environmental factors producing decided right-left genetic factors have been implicated in certain conditions such as multiple neuro-fibromatosis which has a familial incidence associated with a dominant another example of significant facial asymmetry occurs with hemifacial microsomia (figure 1). some clefts of the lip and/or palate are genetically influenced and result in a facial deformity with collapse of the maxillary dental such an asymmetry should show a chance distribution to either the right or left side. yet some unilateral clefts occur roughly twice as often on the left side as on the right. since it is difficult to find any nongenetic factor that would account for such the assumption is that the preference is associated with genetic differences between the halves of the body. intra-uterine pressure during pregnancy and significant pressure in the birth canal during parturition can have observable effects on the bones of the fetal skull. molding of the parietal and facial bones from these pressures can result in facial asymmetry. these effects are generally transient with rapid restoration of the normal relationships of the skull few weeks to several months. craniofacial asymmetry can be caused by various forms of pathology that are not necessarily congenital in nature. osteochondroma of the mandibular condyle results in facial asymmetry, open bite on the involved side, and mandibular deviation (figure 2).","{'answer_start': [1510], 'text': ['facial asymmetry, open bite on the involved side, and mandibular deviation']}",,pathology,"{'authors': ['Samir E.

"regarding cone-beam computed tomography (cbct) imaging, what is the effect of lowering the field of view (fov) on the radiation dose?","the effective doses obtained showed that standard cbct imaging still imparted higher doses of radiation than conventional orthodontic radiographs, even with shielding. ffov scans incorporating nasion to menton and tmj in the adult and child phantoms were tested. the effective dose of a ffov cbct in standard mode was more than six times higher in the adult phantom and more than two times higher in the child phantom than doses in the respective panoramic and lateral cephalometric radiographs combined. because decreasing fov lowers dose, lfov scans incorporating orbitale to menton and tmj were tested. the lfov scan combined with a lateral cephalometric radiograph can replicate information obtained from conventional orthodontic radiographs. in addition, the eyes and true horizontal can be used instead of the cranial base as a reference point in cephalometric analysis, making it possible to diagnose the relationship of the jaws and teeth with just a radiograph localized to the upper and lower jaws superimposed on photographic images of the whole face. even with shielding, the effective dose of lfov scans for the adult and child phantoms in standard mode were significantly higher than the dose of panoramic radiographs. however, a shielded lfov scan combined with a lateral cephalometric radiograph yielded significantly lower doses (p < .001) than the ffov scan in both the adult and child phantoms. limiting the fov on a cbct scan allows for increased radiation shielding. if the clinician deems a high-resolution cbct and cranial base visualization to be necessary for treatment planning, a shielded lfov scan combined with a lateral cephalometric radiograph resulted in less radiation exposure than a ffov scan.","{'answer_start': [513], 'text': ['decreasing fov lowers dose']}",,clinical,"{'authors': ['Stephanie Ting a', 'Diana Attaia b', 'K.

"in an ideal smile arc, how are the maxillary incisal edges positioned relative to the lower lip?","the primary goals of orthodontics are to establish occlusal harmony within and between the maxillary and mandibular dentition while maintaining or enhancing facial esthetics. an attractive smile is considered one of the most important attributes of facial esthetics. esthetic considerations in selecting orthodontic treatment goals have become increasingly important. attempts have been made to define and quantify the smile characteristics that are considered ideal both from orthodontists' and laypersons' perspectives. vertical positioning of upper incisors and configuration of the smile arc are two significant factors that influence smile attractiveness. angle stated that if teeth were in proper occlusion, optimal facial esthetics would be produced. burstone indicated that facial esthetics, perioral function, and stability were influenced by soft tissues. he defined anterior tooth display or lip-to-tooth as the vertical length of maxillary incisors showing below the lip at rest when both lips were unstrained and the teeth were together. peck et al. introduced the concept of smile esthetics and sought to examine the nature of the gingival smile line. ackerman and ackerman popularized the term smile arc to describe the relationship between the upper anterior teeth and the contour of the lower lip. hulsey, rigsbee et al, and ackerman and ackerman found that the unstrained, posed smile could be reproduced consistently. sarver described the smile arc as the relationship of the curvature of the incisal edges of the maxillary incisors and canines to the curvature of the lower lip in the posed smile. the ideal smile arc has maxillary incisal edges parallel to the curve of the lower lip upon smile (consonant). a smile is flat if the incisal edges are straight, and reverse if the incisal edges are aligned in an arc opposite to the contour of the lower lip. a consonant smile is considered more youthful and attractive in appearance. hulsey evaluated the smile line and showed that harmony between an arc of curvature connecting the incisal edges of upper incisors and the upper border of the lower lip was an important characteristic of an attractive smile. attractive smiles also displayed symmetry with the upper lip at the height of the gingival margin of the upper central incisors on smile. mackley attempted to determine effects of orthodontics on the smile and found that the most attractive smiles had a smiling lip line close to the gingival margin of the upper incisors. patients who showed the greatest improvements in smile appearance had a decreased vertical lip-to-tooth relationship with an increase in maxillary incisor torque. sarver and ackerman showed that careful leveling without intrusion of the maxillary incisors was important to preserve a favorable smile arc. to control overbite and maintain smile esthetics, intrusion of mandibular incisors, rather than maxillary incisors was suggested.","{'answer_start': [1642], 'text': ['maxillary incisal edges parallel to the curve of the lower lip upon smile']}",,clinical,"{'authors': ['Ahmad M.

what were the records used in this study?,"the study was approved by the albert einstein college of medicine institutional review board. subjects were drawn from the existing database of orthodontic records in a private orthodontic office in new york city. all records included photographs, digital panoramic and cephalometric radiographs (planmeca, roselle, il), and digital models from an intraoral scanner (itero, align technology, san jose, ca), all uploaded into dolphin imaging (patterson, st. paul, mn). only pretreatment records were evaluated for inclusion. records were sorted chronologically, starting at the oldest. overjet, as measured on digital models, was used as a proxy for skeletal classification. less than 0 mm of overjet was designated class iii, more than 3 mm of overjet designated class ii, and between 0 and 3 mm designated class i. to narrow the focus to anteroposterior issues, individuals with anterior open bite were excluded. those without fully erupted upper or lower second molars were also excluded, as were any intraoral scans that did not fully capture the second molars. the first 25 consecutive records that fit each classification were selected for the study. digital models were downloaded into orthocad (cadent, carlstadt, nj). each model was oriented such that the occlusal plane was horizontal and perpendicular to the screen, with the second molars oriented toward the viewer and incisors away from the viewer. lower models and bites were not included, blinding investigators to the classification of each cast. an image of the digital model in this orientation was imported into powerpoint (microsoft, redmond, wa). a one-pixel line was drawn between the mesiolingual cusps of the upper first molars, serving as a proxy to the occlusal plane. one pixel lines were drawn from the mesiobuccal to mesiopalatal/palatal cusp of each of the right and left second molars to establish a right and left molar plane. figure 1 shows an example of the constructed lines. the images were printed and a protractor was used to record the angle between the occlusal plane and each molar plane by a single orthodontist. ten images were randomly selected to repeat the angle construction and measurement to assess intra-operator reliability and a second orthodontist repeated the angle construction to assess interoperator reliability.","{'answer_start': [235], 'text': ['photographs, digital panoramic and cephalometric radiographs (planmeca, roselle, il), and digital models from an intraoral scanner (itero, align technology, san jose, ca)']}",,other,"{'authors': ['Timothy P.

where is the approximate/theoretical center of resistance for a maxillary molar?,"the movement of the crown and apex in opposite directions was shown by a number of headgear patients (fig. 9). clinically, these patients exhibited no correction of the class ii molar relationship. in fact, some had an increase in the severity of this relationship. this occurred in spite of faithful headgear wear. the problem was apparent. their headgear force vectors were being delivered at too great a distance from the center of resistance. this produced a center of rotation near the center of resistance and consequently mesial movement of the crown. if long outer headgear bows are used, they must be adjusted carefully so that the resultant force vector is not too far from the center of resistance of the molar. this will allow anticipated distal movement of the molar crown to take place. it must be remembered that the length of the outer facebow does not determine the moment on the molar, but that the perpendicular distance from the force vector to the center of resistance does. figure 10 shows varying lengths of outer facebows al] having the same effect, translation, on the molar. vector to the center of resistance does. theoretically, if a force is directed through the center of resistance of a body, it will translate. in this experimental group three patients showed translation. the superimposed force system passed through the trifurcation of the molar in all three cases indicating that the center of resistance was located in this area. the other patients exhibited centers of rotation that would be compatible with a theoretical location of the center of resistance at the trifurcation. the activated facebows corresponded to the correct force system rather than the passive facebows. for instance, in a routine cervical traction system with high outer bows, the outer facebow arms are pulled inferiorly as traction is applied. the force vector should be figured from the activated system. the critical factor is the perpendicular distance from the line of force to the center of resistance (figs. 11a-c).","{'answer_start': [1596], 'text': ['at the trifurcation']}",,biomechanics,"{'authors': ['FRANK W.

"regarding craniofacial growth, are greater rates of true rotation of the mandible are noted in childhood or adolescence?","true mandibular rotation provides important information for an understanding of facial growth changes. it has been related directly to both the direction and the amount of condylar growth, with increasing amounts of true forward rotation associated with greater and more anterior condylar growth. greater true forward rotation has been associated with greater decreases in the gonial angle, more horizontal displacement of the chin, greater increases in posterior facial height, smaller increases in relative anterior facial height, and greater reductions in the anb and mandibular plane angles. true forward rotation also has been associated with bony modeling changes, including increased deposition at the posterior ramus, increased resorption at the posterior lower border of the ramus, and increased deposition at the anterior lower border. increased amounts of true forward rotation also have been related to greater mesial migration of the molars, greater molar than incisor eruption, and greater incisor proclination. depending on the location of the mandible's center of rotation, excessive true forward rotation can give rise to a deep bite malocclusion. the mandible typically rotates in a forward direction, with greater rates of true rotation noted during childhood than during adolescence (table 1). skieller et al reported an average change of 1.0 degree/y during the 6 years surrounding the pubertal growth spurt. odegaard showed that the mandible rotates forward 0.8 degree/y in subjects 7 to 14 years of age; lavergne and gasson reported 0.9 degree/y forward rotation between 7 and 19 years of age. based on longitudinal data, spady et al reported 0.9 degree/y of true forward rotation per year between 6 and 11 years and 0.4 degree/y between 11 and 15 years of age. miller and kerr11 also reported higher rates of true rotation during childhood (1.3 degrees/y) than during adolescence (0.4 degree/y). karlsen showed similar rates of true forward mandibular rotation (1.3 degree/y) during childhood (6 to 12 y) and adolescence (12 to 15 y), perhaps related to the age spans of the samples.","{'answer_start': [1262], 'text': ['during childhood']}",,growth,"{'authors': ['Malanie K.

"in untreated subjects, what changes in arch length occur after late mixed dentition?","to help separate the effects of growth from those of treatment changes in stability studies, several authors have studied arch dimension changes in untreated samples. in an untreated sample, found that the mandibular intermolar distance increased between the ages of 9 and 14, but thereafter remained constant. arch length decreased between the ages of 9 and 14, corresponding to the replacement of the deciduous by the teeth, and remained constant after 14 years of age. intercanine width changes in untreated samples have been studied by barrow and white, moorrees, and sillman. they all observed that there is a rapid increase in intercanine width from 6 to 9 years of age, due to permanent incisor and canine eruption. from 10 to 12 years of age intercanine width decreases, and the decrease remains stable according to moorrees and sillman but continues to decrease according to other authors. moorrees suggested that the decreasing incisor-canine circumference noted from 12 to 18 years is associated with a decrease in arch length rather than a narrowing of arch width. sinclair and little examined 65 untreated normal and revealed a consistent trend toward a decrease in arch length in the mixed dentition to early adulthood. there was a slight decrease in intercanine width, especially in females from 13 to 20 years old. molar width generally remained the same. incisor irregularity increased in the 13 to 20-year-old females, with females exhibiting more incisor irregularity than males in all stages. no association or predictors of clinical value were found. in an effort to better quantify crowding of the mandibular anterior teeth, little proposed the use of the irregularity index (iri). the irregularity index measures displaced contact points and provides an objective value to quantify crowding. it has not been found to be a predictor of future crowding when used in the permanent or mixed dentition. this index does not take into account the mixed dentition leeway space. several arch length analyses in the mixed dentition can be used to help predict crowding by measuring the size of unerupted canines and premolars. gardner evaluated four mixed dentition analyses to determine which was most accurate. he found that the hixon-oldfather analysis was the best predictor of an arch length deficiency.","{'answer_start': [1165], 'text': ['a decrease in arch length in the mixed dentition to early adulthood']}",,growth,"{'authors': ['Steven A.

"in mixed dentition, what is the rationale behind the lower lingual holding arch?","rebellato et al. demonstrated the effectiveness of a lingual arch in preventing mesial migration of the first permanent molars, thus maintaining arch length through the transition from late mixed dentition to permanent dentition. brennan and gianelly showed that significant crowding of mandibular incisors of up to almost 5 mm could be resolved through placement of a passive lower lingual holding arch. debaets and chiarini, dugoni et al., and villalobos et al. in separate studies all showed lower incisor crowding relief on the order of 2 to 4 mm with timely placement of a lower lingual holding arch in the transitional dentition. this technique of preservation of mandibular e-space to resolve mild to moderate crowding has gained popularity and has likely contributed to the decrease in the number of extraction cases over the past several decades. surveys of orthodontic practitioners indicate that percentages of extraction cases have shown a steady decline from 35% in 1986 to 18% in 2008. however, prevention of the so-called late mesial shift, as described by baum, interferes with conversion of a flush terminal plane occlusion-to-class i molar relationship and decreases the amount of posterior arch length available for the erupting second molar that is potentially contributing to its impaction. several studies report that the prevalence of impacted second molars in the general population ranges from 0.2% to 2.3%. studies examining the impact of available space for mandibular third molar eruption have revealed a direct relationship between available space and likelihood of impaction. the study of rtun et al. reported that maxillary third molar impaction could be predicted according to the size of the retromolar space and the amount of mesial molar movement that occurred following premolar extraction therapy. investigators observed a 34% reduction in impaction for every millimeter of space created through mesialization of the molars. they also found a relationship between angulation of the third molar and likelihood of impaction. mesial angulation of the third molar of 30 degrees relative to the occlusal plane resulted in a fivefold increase in impactions when compared with molars angulated 30 degrees distally. a similar study by kim et al. yielded similar results, namely, that premolar extractions resulting in mesialization of molars resulted in fewer cases of impacted third molars when compared with treatment through a nonextraction approach. the aim of the present study was to examine the effect of mandibular e-space preservation on mandibular second molar impaction. the null hypothesis was that there is no difference in the prevalence of second molar impaction between patients treated with e-space preservation and historic controls of untreated patients. additionally, we hypothesized that several variables, including second molar angulation, spacing, and third molar presence, may contribute to these eruption problems.","{'answer_start': [69], 'text': ['preventing mesial migration of the first permanent molars, thus maintaining arch length through the transition from late mixed dentition to permanent dentition']}",,clinical,"{'authors': ['Andrew Sonis', 'Marc Ackerman'], 'doi': 'https://doi.org/10.2319/030711-165.1', 'meta': 'Angle Orthod (2011) 81 (6): 1045–1049.', 'title': 'E-space preservation: Is there a relationship to mandibular second molar impaction?'}",c8435f25-86cb-4d60-bff9-603bbba94d4c
"regarding preadjusted edgewise appliances, which factors will affect torque expression?","the preadjusted edgewise straight wire appliance was introduced in the 1970s. since then, there have been many suggested modifications to the bracket prescriptions in terms of torque and tip values, often differing by only a few degrees. differences in the torque prescription of the various preadjusted edgewise appliance systems are often the reason given for choosing one prescription over another. it is known that torque expression is affected by the amount of play between the archwire and the bracket slot and by variations in tooth anatomy, variations in bracket placement, inaccuracies in the bracket slot and archwire dimensions, mode of ligation of an archwire, and stiffness of the archwire. the mbt and roth bracket prescriptions are the two commonly used preadjusted edgewise appliance systems in the united kingdom. in the orthodontic literature, one previous study has compared the subjective outcome of the two appliances (mbt and roth); the results of that study showed that the bracket prescription had no effect on the subjective esthetic judgments of posttreatment study models made by nine experienced orthodontists. traditionally, incisor inclination has been assessed by lateral cephalometric radiograph; however, this technique is known to be less than ideal and has the disadvantage of subjecting the participant to ionizing radiation. a more recent method is using three-dimensional (3d) digital dental models obtained from laser scanning, which has been shown to be as reliable as cephalometric superimpositions for assessing orthodontic tooth movement. the aim of this study was to determine if there were any significant differences in the final crown inclination of the anterior teeth in patients treated with a roth or an mbt bracket prescription. the null hypothesis tested was that there is no difference in the final crown inclination of the maxillary central incisor, maxillary canine, and mandibular central incisor between patients treated using a roth or an mbt prescription.","{'answer_start': [452], 'text': ['the amount of play between the archwire and the bracket slot and by variations in tooth anatomy, variations in bracket placement, inaccuracies in the bracket slot and archwire dimensions, mode of ligation of an archwire, and stiffness of the archwire']}",,clinical,"{'authors': ['Mohit Mittal', 'Badri Thiruvenkatachari', 'Paul Jonathan Sandler', 'Philip E.

"regarding subjects with an oronasal breathing pattern, what are the dental and craniofacial characteristics that can be observed?","the switch from a nasal to an oronasal breathing pattern induces functional adaptations that have for at least a century been associated with a deviant craniofacial growth pattern. the typical dental and morphological characteristics associated with nasal impairment have been reviewed in detail elsewhere and can be summarized as follows: an increase in total anterior face height which is mostly contributed to by a more vertical development of the lower anterior face. concomitantly, an increase in the mandibular plane and gonial angles and a tipping of the palate can be found. facial prognathism is reported to be decreased. the typical physionomy of the so-called adenoid facies is depicted in fig. 1. the features described bear a remarkable resemblance to those reported as typical for an extreme vertical growth pattern resulting in the long face syndrome (fig. 2) and as a consequence the associations found in the clinical studies mentioned above have prompted the hypothesis that mouthbreathing must be regarded as a major etiological factor in inducing excessive vertical growth. historically, several mechanisms have been suggested to act on the development of the maxilla and the other skeletal structures during impaired nasal breathing, e.g. atrophy of the nasal cavity by inactivity. upward direction of the airstream on the palate and raised negative pressure in the nasal cavity. the prevailing belief today is that alteration in postural muscle activity influences the position of the teeth as well as the growth behavior of some craniofacial structures. an alternative contemporary hypothesis suggests that a soft tissue stretching mechanism elicits a morphogenetic response leading to the same results. however, considerable controversy exists about this form-function relationship and throughout orthodontic history numerous reports have denied this association.","{'answer_start': [340], 'text': ['an increase in total anterior face height which is mostly contributed to by a more vertical development of the lower anterior face. concomitantly, an increase in the mandibular plane and gonial angles and a tipping of the palate can be found. facial prognathism is reported to be decreased']}",,pathology,"{'authors': ['Luc P.

"regarding post-orthodontic relapse, during which decade postretention does crowding relapse increase the most?","in an effort to find predictors for the relapse of mandibular anterior crowding, little, et al. assessed 65 patients, all at least 10 years postretention, who been treated in the permanent dentition with first premolar extraction. the long-term response to mandibular anterior alignment was unpredictable. no variables, such as degree of initial crowding, age, gender, angle classification, etc., were useful in establishing a prognosis. seventy percent of the patients had unsatisfactory mandibular anterior alignment in the postretention stage. patients who were only slightly crowded before treatment usually became moderately crowded. when the same patients were analyzed cephalometrically, no predictors of long-term relapse of mandibular incisor crowding could be found. in another study, little, et al., investigated whether a similar trend occurred from 10 to 20 years postretention. crowding continued to increase during this later phase but to a lesser degree than during the first 10 years of postretention. only 10% of the patients were judged to have clinically acceptable mandibular alignment at the last stage of diagnostic records. patients responded in diverse and unpredictable manners with no apparent predictors of future success when compared to pretreatment records or to the treated result. riedel has suggested that in patients with severely crowded mandibular arches, the removal of one or more mandibular incisors is the only logical alternative which may allow for increased stability of the mandibular anteriors without continued retention.","{'answer_start': [982], 'text': ['the first 10 years of postretention']}",,clinical,"{'authors': ['Richard A.

"in growing class ii patients treated with functional appliances, what are the factors that affect the long-term stability of the treatment?","the most common skeletal problem in orthodontics is the class ii malocclusion characterized by mandibular retrognathia. in addition, most subjects with this type of malocclusion exhibit narrow maxillary arches. the effects and stability of early class ii treatment with functional appliances has been surrounded by much controversy and uncertainty. it has been shown in histologic studies with laboratory animals that when the mandible is brought forward there is an increase in cellular activity at the condylar head as well as an increase in mandibular length. numerous studies have shown condylar and glenoid fossa remodeling following the use of various types of functional appliances. questions that still remain are: (1) are these findings substantiated with clinical research in humans; (2) is the growth of the mandible different with functional treatment than that of similar controls; and (3) is this treatment stable over the long-term? there are multiple factors that influence the stability of early class ii treatment including mandibular rotational growth patterns, airway obstructions, proper manipulation of appliances, treatment timing, and retention. there are few investigators who have studied the long-term stability with functional appliances, and most have reported favorable findings with prolonged retention. the present study was designed to assess the treatment outcome of tooth-borne functional appliances (bionator, acrylic splint herbst, twin block, and mandibular anterior repositioning appliance [mara]) and their stability over time and after fixed appliance therapy, when compared to each other and to untreated controls with similar class ii malocclusions. the treatment sample consisted of 80 patients, with similar class ii skeletal characteristics. the patients were divided equally among bionator, removable acrylic herbst, twin block, and mara functional appliance groups. they were treated by two orthodontists who followed the same functional treatment philosophies and selected the appliances for each group based on anticipated patient cooperation and stability of the existing mixed dentition. the distribution of sexes was closely matched in all treatment groups. the initial mean age for the bionator group was 10 years 7 months (range, 8 years 7 months to 13 years 9 months), for the acrylic herbst group, 12 years 2 months (range, 10 years 6 months to 14 years 1 month), for the twin block group 10 years 11 months (range, 8 years 2 months to 13 years 9 months), and for the mara group 11 years 1 month (range, 9 years 0 months to 14 years 4 months). although there appears to be a discrepancy between the chronologic ages between the samples, they were all matched carefully for growth stages by cervical vertebral maturation (cvm) evaluation.","{'answer_start': [1042], 'text': ['mandibular rotational growth patterns, airway obstructions, proper manipulation of appliances, treatment timing, and retention']}",,clinical,"{'authors': ['Nicole J.

"regarding the growth of the craniofacial complex, which structure contains synchondroses?","the fgf and msx genes are important for craniofacial development, particularly for the calvaria, as highlighted by the etiologic relationship between mutations of these genes and human craniosynostosis. however, the role of the fgf and msx genes in the ventral part of the cranium, the cranial base, are largely unknown, and this structure is important for coordinated development and growth of craniofacial skeletons. the cranial base, or basicranium, plays a key role in integrated craniofacial development. it is different from the facial bones that are formed through intramembranous ossification. the cranial base is formed through endochondral ossification and, in this process, a cartilage template is formed first and eventually replaced by bone via chondrocyte apoptosis and osteogenic cell migration. well-organized cartilaginous structures analogous to long-bone growth plates, termed synchondroses, are formed among cranial base bones, acting as growth centers in advancing growth. cranial base synchondroses ossify at different growth stages in human beings, and are regulated by a mechanism that, thus far, is not completely understood. the cranial base is a unique structure that differs from other endochondral bones. skeletogenic cells of the cranial base are derived from paraxial somites in the posterior part and from the neural crest in the anterior part. these two different embryologic parts are distinguishable by distinct growth features. the posterior cranial base matures and reaches its final size earlier than the anterior cranial base. however, the anterior cranial base has a more active and more prolonged growth process that lasts to a very late growth stage. this feature is a prerequisite for coordinated craniofacial development and growth. the basicranium also differs from other portions of the endochondral skeleton; to a great extent, the development and growth of the basicranium are under the influence of the brain, and the final shape and size of the basicranium follow that of the brain. cranial base angulation is formed by the relative flexion of its anterior and posterior parts, and is a unique feature of human beings and a reflection of brain evolution.","{'answer_start': [928], 'text': ['cranial base bones']}",,growth,"{'authors': ['Xuguang Nie'], 'doi': 'https://doi.org/10.2319/082305-298', 'meta': 'Angle Orthod (2006) 76 (6): 990–995.', 'title': 'Developmentally Regulated Expression of Msx1, Msx2 and Fgfs in the Developing Mouse Cranial Base'}",26375c86-b846-481c-9b84-0b9e51fbf2d0
"regarding smile esthetics, what is the smile arc?","the primary goals of orthodontics are to establish occlusal harmony within and between the maxillary and mandibular dentition while maintaining or enhancing facial esthetics. an attractive smile is considered one of the most important attributes of facial esthetics. esthetic considerations in selecting orthodontic treatment goals have become increasingly important. attempts have been made to define and quantify the smile characteristics that are considered ideal both from orthodontists' and laypersons' perspectives. vertical positioning of upper incisors and configuration of the smile arc are two significant factors that influence smile attractiveness. angle stated that if teeth were in proper occlusion, optimal facial esthetics would be produced. burstone indicated that facial esthetics, perioral function, and stability were influenced by soft tissues. he defined anterior tooth display or lip-to-tooth as the vertical length of maxillary incisors showing below the lip at rest when both lips were unstrained and the teeth were together. peck et al. introduced the concept of smile esthetics and sought to examine the nature of the gingival smile line. ackerman and ackerman popularized the term smile arc to describe the relationship between the upper anterior teeth and the contour of the lower lip. hulsey, rigsbee et al, and ackerman and ackerman found that the unstrained, posed smile could be reproduced consistently. sarver described the smile arc as the relationship of the curvature of the incisal edges of the maxillary incisors and canines to the curvature of the lower lip in the posed smile. the ideal smile arc has maxillary incisal edges parallel to the curve of the lower lip upon smile (consonant). a smile is flat if the incisal edges are straight, and reverse if the incisal edges are aligned in an arc opposite to the contour of the lower lip. a consonant smile is considered more youthful and attractive in appearance. hulsey evaluated the smile line and showed that harmony between an arc of curvature connecting the incisal edges of upper incisors and the upper border of the lower lip was an important characteristic of an attractive smile. attractive smiles also displayed symmetry with the upper lip at the height of the gingival margin of the upper central incisors on smile. mackley attempted to determine effects of orthodontics on the smile and found that the most attractive smiles had a smiling lip line close to the gingival margin of the upper incisors. patients who showed the greatest improvements in smile appearance had a decreased vertical lip-to-tooth relationship with an increase in maxillary incisor torque. sarver and ackerman showed that careful leveling without intrusion of the maxillary incisors was important to preserve a favorable smile arc. to control overbite and maintain smile esthetics, intrusion of mandibular incisors, rather than maxillary incisors was suggested.","{'answer_start': [1471], 'text': ['the relationship of the curvature of the incisal edges of the maxillary incisors and canines to the curvature of the lower lip in the posed smile']}",,clinical,"{'authors': ['Ahmad M.

"regarding craniofacial growth, what is the contribution of the maxilla to total vertical growth?","the average total vertical growth was 6.3 mm in the untreated cases, while in the treated individuals it was 7.1 mm. since both untreated and treated groups had almost identical average growth of the condyles, it was thought that they could be compared, giving an opportunity to see differences in the behavior of the chin. of the 6.3 mm of total vertical growth in the untreated group, 73% (4.6 mm) was in the maxilla and 27% (1.7 mm) in the mandible. two and six-tenths mm of the maxillary growth was in the body of the maxilla and 2.0 mm in the alveolar process. of the total vertical growth in the treated group, 4.8 mm or 68% was contributed by the maxilla, and 2.3 mm or 32% by the mandible. the maxillary growth in this group was made up of 2.4 mm in the body and 2.4 mm in the alveolar process. thus, it may be seen that the maxilla is responsible for about 70% of total vertical growth and therefore has an important effect on the tilt of the mandible. in the treated cases the amount and distribution of vertical growth was different from that of the nontreated cases. this difference was an increase principally in the mandibular alveolar process. this increase was found to be significant at the 5% level with a ""t"" test reading of 2.35.","{'answer_start': [860], 'text': ['about 70% of total vertical growth']}",,growth,"{'authors': ['F.

"when comparing patients with class i, ii and iii malocclusion to patients with normal occlusion, how does the malocclusion affect the particle sizes in chewing?","median particle size and broadness of the particle distribution (table 2) showed statistically significant (p < .001) group differences. the class i, class ii, and class iii malocclusion groups had median particle sizes approximately 9%, 15%, and 34% larger than the group with normal occlusion, respectively. post-hoc tests showed that the group with normal occlusion had significantly (p < .02) smaller median particle size and broader distributions than the class ii and class iii groups. the class i group also had significantly (p < .01) smaller particles and a broader distribution of particles than the class iii group. there were no significant group differences in the number of chews to swallow either jerky or almonds. patients with malocclusion also perceived chewing disabilities with the harder foods. there were significant group differences (table 3) in the reported ability to chew fresh carrots or celery and steaks or other firm meats (figure 2). the group with normal occlusion reported a significantly (p < .05) greater ability to chew fresh carrots and celery than all 3 malocclusion groups. they also reported being better able (p < .01) to chew steak and other firm meats than the class ii or class iii groups. the class i group also reported being more able (p < .05) to chew steak and other firm meats than the class iii group. approximately 25% of the class iii group reported difficulties in chewing raw carrots, raw celery, steak, or other firm meats. both the objective and subjective measures of masticatory performance showed relationships with malocclusion. correlations between the number of occluding teeth and perceived chewing ability have been reported. it has also been shown that class ii girls perceive greater reductions in masticatory abilities compared to girls with normal occlusion. on the other hand, it has been reported that adult masticatory performance is not related to food choices or satisfaction with chewing ability. the disagreements between studies may be influenced by the way in which the questionnaires were administered to the subjects, a process that is more difficult to control than the collection of objective measures of masticatory performance. for example, studies showing no correlations often used yes and no answers to assess difficulty chewing, while those finding correlations used a visual analog scale to evaluate difficulty chewing. importantly, the study using techniques similar to ours reported agreement between subjective and objective measures of masticatory performance.","{'answer_start': [141], 'text': ['class i, class ii, and class iii malocclusion groups had median particle sizes approximately 9%, 15%, and 34% larger than the group with normal occlusion, respectively']}",,clinical,"{'authors': ['Jeryl D.

"in the school age population of the united states, what ratio has a malocclusion that would require orthodontic treatment?","throughout most of the world, the need for orthodontic treatment far exceeds the available supply. as noted by kreshover, in the united states alone, approximately one-third of the school age population suffers from malocclusions severe enough to require orthodontic treatment. thus, in 1968, some fourteen million american children could have benefited from such care. however, the four thousand orthodontists in practice that year could treat less than 10% of this group. it is therefore of considerable interest to develop objective criteria for the assessment of the need for orthodontic treatment which might aid in the selection of patients to be treated and in estimating the prevalence of malocclusion in this, and other, populations. while such an orthodontic treatment priority index (tpi) clearly depends on a variety of factors, the first step in its construction would logically seem to involve the selection of several dentofacial measurements which could be used to characterize the dentofacial morphology of potential patients in the context of their need for treatment. a number of investigations, primarily within the american and scandinavian populations, have provided valuable information in this in particular, these studies have verified the earlier, more subjective estimates of the prevalence of malocclusion in these populations. the disparity between supply and demand in the netherlands is similarly acute and it has recently been estimated that the percentage of dutch children requiring orthodontic treatment is even greater than that observed in the united states. the purpose of the present paper, then, is to take the first step in the construction of an orthodontic tpi for dutch children. the statistical techniques of stepwise multiple regression and discriminant function are used to study a set of dentofacial measurements to determine which of these measurements are most related to the clinicians assessment of the need for orthodontic treatment and which of these measurements best discriminate the children who do require orthodontic treatment from those who do not.","{'answer_start': [150], 'text': ['approximately one-third of the school age population']}",,clinical,"{'authors': ['CHARLES J.

"regarding orthodontically induced external apical root resorption (oiearr), which cytokine imbalance is associated with decreased bone remodelling?","several gene-sequence variants in proteins regulating inflammation, including il-1a, il-1b, and il-ra, have been described previously. interleukin 1 is one of the first cytokines implicated in inflammation of the vessel wall during tooth movement, affecting leucocyte recruitment and transmigration. closely connected to this, the function of interleukin 1 is antagonized by the il1ra protein encoded in the il1rn gene, wherein specific sequence variants have been associated with an increased predisposition to suffer oiearr. in this connection, subjects homozygous for the t allele of the il1rn variant studied here may be prone to imbalances in cytokine levels on the il1ra/il1b axis during orthodontic tooth movement, which may be associated with a decreased bone remodeling rate that directly influences the subsequent increase in radicular stress. failure to identify the dna information of each subject means failing to include the risk inherent in certain patient genotypes, which leads to misinterpreting the observed results of the appliance's effect on oiearr. therefore, to properly adjust for the effects of each clinical or treatment- related factor, subject selection in orthodontic research related to oiearr should include dna information. orthodontic loading of the teeth with either fixed or removable appliances triggers a cellular and molecular response that enables the roots to move through alveolar bone. it is the same type of cell response that may, in certain cases, lead to oiearr, so that treatment with aligners is not exempt from the same iatrogenic effect. it has been argued that there are differences in the type of force between intermittent (aligners) vs continuous (fixed) appliances and the potential control of the former over magnitude of force compared with the latter. it has been claimed that intermittent forces may allow the cementum at the root to heal and so prevent further resorption during the pause. nevertheless, these forces have also been associated with detrimental jiggling forces and, likely of greater significance, the current aligner treatment protocols suggest an almost full-day use, which means they can almost be considered a type of continuous force with reactivation (aligner change) at a shorter time period (commonly 15 days, although several clinicians suggest changing them in less than a week). we might expect differences in the magnitude and levels of force to account for differences in the expression of oiearr. nevertheless, current protocols for fixed appliances usually involve the sequential use of light forces at each step, which may be the reason why the predisposition to oiearr using fixed appliances is similar to that with removable aligners (p > .05).","{'answer_start': [634], 'text': ['imbalances in cytokine levels on the il1ra/il1b axis']}",,biology,"{'authors': ['Alejandro Iglesias-Linares', 'Boris Sonnenberg', 'Beatriz Solano', 'Rosa-Maria Yañez-Vico', 'Enrique Solano', 'Steven J Lindauer', 'Carlos Flores-Mir'], 'doi': 'https://doi.org/10.2319/02016-101.1', 'meta': 'Angle Orthod (2017) 87 (1): 3–10.', 'title': 'Orthodontically induced external apical root resorption in patients treated with fixed appliances vs removable aligners'}",c120fd01-de22-4a65-bf7d-d7513497deb3
what is a potential complication associated with maxillary canine impaction?,"patients with impacted maxillary canines and significant resorption of the adjacent lateral incisors present the dental team with significant treatment challenges. to address these challenges effectively, it is helpful to review the literature on the etiology and incidence of both canine impaction and root resorption, especially resorption associated with impaction. treatment of a case with bilateral maxillary canine impaction and associated lateral incisor root resorption is reported. maxillary canine impaction occurs in approximately 1% to 2% of the population. females are affected approximately twice as often as males. approximately 80% to 90% of impacted canines are palatal and 10% to 20% are labial. the maxillary canine has the longest and most tortuous path of eruption, from its site of formation lateral to the piriform fossa to its final position in the arch. endocrine deficiencies, febrile diseases, and irradiation can cause general retardations in eruption, and thus can affect canine eruption. etiologic agents that may influence canines more specifically include lack of space, early loss or prolonged retention of the primary canine, abnormal position of the tooth bud, ankylosis, cystic or neoplastic formation, root dilaceration, and the iatrogenic repositioning of the adjacent lateral incisor into the canines path of eruption. palatal impactions have been associated with the absence of roots or variations in the root size of the associated maxillary lateral incisor. a genetic origin for the palatally displaced canine has also been proposed. dental crowding is more often associated with labial impactions than with palatal impactions. root resorption has been found to occur in 80% to 100% of adults, even those who have not received orthodontic treatment. orthodontic treatment is one well-documented factor in root resorption, and resorption during treatment is more likely if the teeth already show some evidence of resorption. fortunately, the resorption that is related to orthodontic treatment almost never progresses after the orthodontic forces are discontinued.","{'answer_start': [331], 'text': ['resorption associated with impaction']}",,pathology,"{'authors': ['W.

"for the orthodontist, what are the main goals of profile analysis?","other occlusal characteristics that general dentists indicated as important when evaluating postorthodontic occlusions that are part of the abo criteria and part of andrews' six keys are class i canines and class i molars. the characteristic of even contact of all teeth in centric occlusion also was indicated as an important occlusal characteristic by the general dentists, but this appears only in the abo's list of criteria. this finding suggests that there should be more communication between orthodontists and general dentists over the criteria for evaluating the clinical outcome of orthodontic treatments. orthodontic education in dental schools, as well as continuing dental education after dental school, needs to be focused on more standardized criteria for evaluation of the outcome of orthodontic treatment. although a small percentage of the respondents ranked condylar position as most important, the results of this study show that the majority of general dentists did not indicate the position of the condyle as an important postorthodontic evaluation characteristic that general dentists evaluate. gnathologists and functional orthodontists are two of the most prominent groups critical of traditional orthodontic treatment interestingly with contradictory paradigms. gnathologists state that if the mandibular condyle is not in a posterior position during maximum dental intercuspation, temporomandibular disorders will ensue. on the other hand, so-called functional orthodontists argue that seating the condyle posteriorly in the glenoid fossa will be detrimental to the health of the temporomandibular joint. the results of the current study indicate that the typical general practitioner is not in either philosophical camp, with only 29% of the respondents choosing condylar position as strongly important. when the respondents were asked to rank four nonocclusal or functionally related characteristics in order of importance, respondents ranked the patient's profile as most important 47% of the time more often than the other three characteristics under consideration. this finding indicates that general dentists highly value a patient's profile. orthodontists also value profiles, relying heavily on pretreatment profile photographs to accurately measure several characteristics of a patient's profile. determination of whether the jaws are positioned proportionately in the anteroposterior plane of space, evaluation of lip posture and incisor prominence, and the assessment of vertical facial proportions and mandibular plane angle are the three main goals in the orthodontic profile analysis. by understanding the measurements of a patient's pretreatment profile, orthodontists formulate treatment plans to maintain or improve profile features during and after orthodontic treatment. thus, the decision of the general dentist to refer a patient to one orthodontist over another is based on a number of interactive factors. it behooves the orthodontic clinician to provide high-quality treatment, to interact well with patients and their families, and to maintain good communications with the general practitioners in the community.","{'answer_start': [2332], 'text': ['determination of whether the jaws are positioned proportionately in the anteroposterior plane of space, evaluation of lip posture and incisor prominence, and the assessment of vertical facial proportions and mandibular plane angle']}",,clinical,"{'authors': ['Jason F.

"in patients receiving orthodontic treatment, what causes external apical root resorption (earr)?","in this case, the maxillary incisors were elevated by 3.5 mm, and there was no vertical molar effect giving clockwise rotation of the mandible. therefore, the implant anchorage demonstrates that maxillary intrusion does not have an effect on vertical molar position and is not influenced by patient cooperation. in addition, it causes almost no relapse in the retention phase, so it may be important for maintaining stability during the retention phase of treatment. previous studies suggest that external apical root resorption (earr) occurs during treatment when forces at the apex exceed the resistance and reparative ability of the periapical tissues. excessive force during treatment increases the risk of earr, particularly if heavy continuous forces are used. accordingly, extremely light forces (15 25 gm) should be used to produce appropriate pressure within the periodontal ligament. in the current patient, an elastic thread and a metal ligature could introduce this optimal light force from mini-implant anchorage. as a result, optimal intrusion could be acquired without earr during the active treatment period. in a crowded case, the decision of whether to perform extraction or nonextraction must be made with consideration given to the arch length discrepancy and the harmony of the soft-tissue profile. proffit and fields recommended nonextraction for cases with an arch length discrepancy less than four mm and extraction for those with discrepancy greater than 10 mm. cases demonstrating a five- to nine-mm arch length discrepancy are considered borderline. the decision would depend on soft-tissue features and incisor position.","{'answer_start': [565], 'text': ['forces at the apex exceed the resistance and reparative ability of the periapical tissues']}",,biology,"{'authors': ['Hidetake Ohnishi', 'Takakazu Yagi', 'Yoshitaka Yasuda', 'Kenji Takada'], 'doi': 'https://doi.org/10.1043/0003-3219(2005)75[444:AMFOAI]2.0.CO;2', 'meta': 'Angle Orthod (2005) 75 (3): 444–452.', 'title': 'A Mini-Implant for Orthodontic Anchorage in a Deep Overbite Case'}",737976c6-a471-4ecc-b8b9-e1c87bae3c2d

what are possible complications associated with palatally displaced maxillary canines (pdcs)?,"permanent canines are the secondmost commonly impacted teeth after third molars, and almost 1% 3% of the population has been found to have impacted maxillary canines. in about 85% of cases with impaction, maxillary canines are palatally displaced. genetic predisposition and several other factors are implicated in the etiology of palatally displaced maxillary canines (pdcs). the management of these clinical problems may require interdisciplinary approaches in addition to substantial participation by orthodontists. complications resulting from pdcs include loss of space in the dental arch, displacement and resorption of adjacent roots, and formation of cysts in rare cases. moreover, patients may undergo traumatic surgical exposure of pdcs, followed by prolonged and costly fixed orthodontic treatment. the management of pdcs may require surgically exposing the canine and applying a fixed orthodontic appliance to guide it into appropriate occlusion or extracting the primary canine to provide space for its successor to eliminate or minimize developing malocclusion, an approach called interceptive orthodontics. early interceptive treatment can lessen the degree of developing malocclusion and thus decrease the need for future orthodontic treatment of permanent teeth. it can also minimize the time and cost of treatment in addition to improving self-esteem and patient satisfaction. previously, ericson and kurol reported that extraction of primary canines is the treatment of choice for impacted maxillary canines, as 78% of such cases resulted in normal occlusion. several prospective studies and a retrospective cohort study have also shown that primary canine extraction facilitated the eruption of pdcs. other studies have reported interceptive extraction of pdcs combined with orthodontic treatment (rapid maxillary expansion) or extraction of primary molars. however, these studies varied considerably in their design, sample-size calculation, criteria for clinical examination, and outcomes. parkin et al. conducted a systematic review in 2009 in which they were unable to provide reliable evidence to support the effectiveness of interceptive extraction of deciduous canines to manage pdcs. later, naoumova et al. (2011) included two studies in their systematic review to determine whether extraction of primary canines helps prevent the impaction of permanent maxillary canines. however, robust evidence in favor of their hypothesis was limited. in 2012, parkin et al. considered two studies for their systematic review to determine whether complications of pdcs can be prevented via the extraction of primary canines. due to the lack of reliable studies, the authors of these systematic reviews stressed the need for more clinical trials with high-quality methodology. as a result, two recent randomized clinical trials reported the spontaneous correction of pdcs after the extraction of primary canines. the present systematic review summarized the relevant randomized clinical trials to provide reliable estimates of the efficacy of interceptive orthodontic intervention, specifically, to find out whether successful management of pdcs can be achieved by interceptive extraction of deciduous maxillary canines.","{'answer_start': [561], 'text': ['loss of space in the dental arch, displacement and resorption of adjacent roots, and formation of cysts in rare cases']}",,pathology,"{'authors': ['Naif N.

what is the suggested treatment if root resorption is detected during orthodontic treatment?,"continuous force application resulted in greater tooth movement, as indicated by buccal cusp movement and lingual cusp movement, which correlated with previous studies that have shown that continuous forces produced greater tooth movement than other types of forces. however, there was a greater unwanted rotational tooth movement in the continuous group compared with the intermittent group. this could mean that more treatment time would be required to de-rotate the tooth and hence less effective tooth movement. moreover, this greater tooth movement in the continuous group was at the expense of more severe root resorption. this information is critical to the patients who are biologically and genetically prone to oiirr, and continuous force should not be used in these patients. weltman et al. suggested a 2- to 3-month pause in the treatment for patients with early detected oiirr to allow cementum healing. in a standard treatment of 18 months, a 2- to 3-month pause for every 3 to 6 months of treatment would be an additional 4 to 15 months of treatment time. perhaps, intermittent force of 28 days on and 7 days off could be a more effective way to move teeth and yet be less detrimental on the root surface for individuals who are prone to oiirr. the key is to retain with a passive archwire during the inactive period to prevent further oiirr at the root apex. further investigations with an improved clinical setup and experiment design will be beneficial to overcome the shortcomings of the present investigation and highlight the clinical relevance. a transpalatal arch should be considered to enhance the molar anchorage unit. this will ensure that the force applied to each experimental premolar is consistent. the experiment period should be defined by the distance moved instead of a set time frame. it is understood by the result of the present investigation that intermittent force resulted in less oiirr and less tooth movement. however, one would question whether the extent of oiirr would still be less if the tooth is moved the same distance because the treatment time would be longer. therefore, it would be more clinically meaningful to compare the extent of oiirr and the required treatment time for the experimental tooth to move to a desired position between the two force regimens (continuous vs intermittent).","{'answer_start': [813], 'text': ['2- to 3-month pause in the treatment']}",,clinical,"{'authors': ['Nurhat Ozkalayci', 'Ersan Ilsay Karadeniz', 'Selma Elekdag-Turk', 'Tamer Turk', 'Lam L.

"regarding mixed dentition treatment, which appliance can be used to maintain the leeway space?","the use of a lingual arch in early mixed dentition treatment has been evaluated by several authors, including wright and kennedy and eastwood, who all stressed the need for the lingual arch to be passive to minimize the side effects of labial displacement of the lower incisors. singer studied the use of a passive lingual arch and found that the appliance does have an active effect on the dentition and can change incisor and molar position. odom found that the lingual arch is effective in maintaining leeway space and does not prevent the normal horizontal or vertical growth changes of the mandibular incisors and molars. to help separate the effects of growth from those of treatment changes in stability studies, several authors have studied arch dimension changes in untreated samples. moorees, in an untreated sample, found that the mandibular intermolar distance increased between the ages of 9 and 14, but thereafter remained constant. arch length decreased between the ages of 9 and 14, corresponding to the replacement of the deciduous by the teeth, and remained constant after 14 years of age.","{'answer_start': [173], 'text': ['the lingual arch']}",,clinical,"{'authors': ['Steven A.

"with respect to the wire lasso technique for the eruption of an impacted canine, what is the main complication associated with this technique?","prior to the introduction of the acid-etch bonding techniques, a popular approach had been to lasso the cervical area of the impacted tooth with a circumferential ligature wire at the time of surgical exposure. this often requires channeling and removal of a large portion of bone overlying the impacted crown. surgical skills and extreme caution are needed to avoid damaging the adjacent teeth, especially in those cases where the impacted crown lies in close proximity. such ligature wires are snugly twisted by the surgeon to avoid slippage when force is applied to move the tooth into the dental arch. a frequent complication of the ensuing orthodontic procedure is the inability to move the tooth due to ankylosis. additionally, the movement of an impacted tooth involves risks of discoloration, devitalization, root resorption, loss of cervical bone and long clinical crown with lack of attached gingivae. the patient and/or parents should be fully aware of these risk factors. many impacted teeth, particularly maxillary cuspids, have been treated with the lasso wire technique over the years with minimal or no damage to the teeth or their supporting structures. however, of all of the previously enumerated factors the risk of external root resorption is especially related to the lasso wire technique. therefore, the hazards of using this technique are discussed in the ensuing cases to alert and caution both orthodontists and oral surgeons.","{'answer_start': [1236], 'text': ['external root resorption']}",,clinical,"{'authors': ['YEHOSHUA SHAPIRA', 'MLADEN M.

"regarding the use of ct scans to detect root resorption, what are important factors for diagnosis of root resorption?","this study shows that ct scanning of maxillary lateral incisors may reliably reveal resorption on the root adjacent to an ectopically erupting maxillary canine provided accurate radiological procedures are used (figures 1 through 7). the comparisons between the clinical in vitro registrations of in vivo resorptions caused by the ectopically positioned canines and the assessment from interpretation of the extent of the resorptions on the ct images showed a high degree of agreement for the extent of loss of root substance, as may be seen from the figures and table 2p < .0004. the predominance of severe damage in the distribution of the graded resorptions is a result of limitations in performing tooth extraction in the region of interest when lesser-damaged teeth are present. this circumstance may have biased the results somewhat, but even the roots with slight or moderate dentine loss showed good agreement between the clinical grading and the radiological assessment on the ct scans. these observations were confirmed by analyzing the roots in all images, scan by scan, since the depth of the resorptions varied within the resorption cavities (figures 1 through 5). this explains the small amount of data in table 2, which compares the clinical and ct assessments based on the maximum depth of root resorption. minor differences in the true morphology of the resorbed cavity and the demarcation of the root lining on the ct images may occur because of the limitations in image resolution and the thickness of the ct scans (2 mm thick), but are of no importance to clinical decision-making. we consider the factors of importance for the results are an optimal orientation of the planes of scanning perpendicular to the long axis of the roots of the incisors, a calibrated ct unit, the use of an ultra-high algorithm for bone resolution imaging, reconstruction from the raw data set and adequate zooming, resulting in enhanced detail sharpness.","{'answer_start': [1660], 'text': ['an optimal orientation of the planes of scanning perpendicular to the long axis of the roots of the incisors, a calibrated ct unit, the use of an ultra-high algorithm for bone resolution imaging, reconstruction from the raw data set and adequate zooming, resulting in enhanced detail sharpness']}",,pathology,"{'authors': ['Sune Ericson, DDS, PhD', 'Jüri Kurol, DDS, PhD'], 'doi': 'https://doi.org/10.1043/0003-3219(2000)070<0276:IRRDTE>2.0.CO;2', 'meta': 'Angle Orthod (2000) 70 (4): 276–283.', 'title': 'Incisor Root Resorptions Due to Ectopic Maxillary Canines Imaged by Computerized Tomography: A Comparative Study in Extracted Teeth'}",43b8c602-a227-4c59-88ab-214260e02110
"when comparing patients treated with extractions to those treated without, what is the overall change observed in intermolar width for each therapy in the maxillary arch?","the age distribution of the subjects in each treatment and sex subgroup is detailed in table 1. student t-test comparisons of the male and female extraction and nonextraction groups indicated that before treatment, the groups were well-matched according to age. however, the length of treatment was significantly longer for males (p = 0.016) and females (p = 0.048) in the extraction group than in the corresponding nonextraction group. because of the large number of parameters compared in this study, only the significant differences will be presented. during treatment (t2-t1), males experienced a significantly greater increase in maxillary interincisal and intercanine width in the extraction group than in the nonextraction group. this increase is the result of aligning the relatively more crowded maxillary anterior segment in the extraction group. during the overall observation period (t3-t1), there was a significant difference in the change in intermolar width between the extraction and nonextraction group. both males and females in the extraction group had a net decrease in the intermolar width while those in the nonextraction group experienced an increase in these dimensions.","{'answer_start': [1021], 'text': ['both males and females in the extraction group had a net decrease in the intermolar width while those in the nonextraction group experienced an increase in these dimensions']}",,clinical,"{'authors': ['Samir E.

"regarding the biomechanics of moments, what tooth movement results from the moment of a couple?","the essence of activating a 2x4 appliance is the creation and control of moments and their equilibrium forces. moments are created by only two mechanisms i) a single force acting away from the center of resistance or, ii) a pair of forces or couple. the moment of a single force results from a point force acting on a tooth away from the center of resistance, causing the tooth to rotate around a center of rotation which is apical to the center of resistance. the moment of a couple results from a couple at the bracket (figure 1) and causes rotation around the center of resistance of the tooth. any single force, including a net equilibrium force resulting from a moment, causes translation of the tooth if applied through the center of resistance of the tooth. since it is rarely possible to apply forces through the center of resistance, forces usually create a moment of the force. this kind of moment is measured by the magnitude of the force times the perpendicular distance from the line of the force to the center of resistance. the moment of the force is varied simply by altering the point of application of the force and is not an inherent property of the equilibrium of a given system as is the moment of the couple. the moment of a couple at any bracket is potentially derived from several components. when a wire is not yet inserted into the brackets and is positioned over two equal sized adjacent brackets, the greater the angle of entry of the wire into the bracket, the greater the moment of the couple at that this angle of entry is affected by preactivation bends in the wire and/or the position of result of tooth malposition or bracket bonding error. since this component of the moment of the couple is determined by the passive wire/bracket slot angulation before the deformation of the wire that results from its placement in the bracket slot, this is termed the passive component of the moment of the couple. in addition, when a wire of any given stiffness is inserted into a bracket slot, deformation of the wire occurs which also contributes to the moment of the couple. this component of the moment of the couple, resulting from deformation of the wire itself, is termed the active component of the moment of the couple. the active component of the moment of a couple naturally decreases as tooth movement occurs with progressive deactivation of the wire.","{'answer_start': [543], 'text': ['rotation around the center of resistance of the tooth']}",,biomechanics,"{'authors': ['Robert J.

"regarding descriptive statistics, what is the standard deviation?","commonly, the research worker is interested in more than a measure of central tendency. not only is the mean informative to him, he needs also indications of the extent to which individual measurements are scattered or dispersed about the mean. if the incisor-mandible angle is 90 within very close limits, it may have more diagnostic utility than if individual values range down to 80 or up to 115. clinically, the range is much used, that is, the lowest and highest value in a series (arranged in increasing order of magnitude). the range as determined in a clinically-healthy population is frequently described as the range-of-normal. however, the range is a deceptive and inadequate measure, changing as it does with sample size, and dependent on measuring errors as well. the larger the sample (n), the wider the range, simply because very small and very large individuals or measurements are increasingly likely to be encountered in large samples, and, since measuring and copying errors tend to throw values to the extreme ends of a distribution, the range is most likely to encompass such errors. the most commonly-used measure of dispersion is the standard deviation, symbolized by sd or the lower case greek letter sigma (o). simply, the standard deviation is the root mean square deviation from the mean. thus, if the deviation (d) from the mean of each individual measurement (x) has been computed, the standard deviation is sqrt(sum(d^2)/n)). however, computing d for each measurement may be avoided by the assumed mean at zero technique in which sigma is calculated as follows.","{'answer_start': [1270], 'text': ['the root mean square deviation from the mean']}",,other,"{'authors': ['Stanley M.

"regarding the pre-surgical orthodontic preparation for orthognathic surgery, what is the effect of improper alignment of second molars?","for decades, orthodontists have debated the routine engagement of second molars due to the technical difficulty of bonding or banding the teeth. however, as surgical patients have third molars that are often impacted, extracted, or absent, second molars usually serve as the terminal teeth in the orthognathic setup. it was observed that class iii surgical patients have second molars lacking in adequate buccal root torque, while class i and ii surgical patients did not share this feature. as the maxillary second molars do not have full occlusal opposition in class iii, but do in class i and ii bites, that should not be unexpected. just as teeth compensate in the anterior for ap skeletal issues, they likewise will compensate in the posterior. it is probable that the mechanism is similar to what occurs when a tooth is left unopposed, either naturally or following extraction. the exact process of unopposed tooth movement is not well understood. compagnon et al. demonstrated that primary eruption occurred with growth of the periodontal complex, and that eruption continued well past 10 years without an opposing tooth. it also has been demonstrated that teeth with as much as 30% partial occlusal contact displayed a similar amount of supraeruption as those with an absent opposing tooth. importantly, unopposed teeth do not simply supraerupt in a purely vertical direction after tooth extraction, as they also will tip and rotate. these misaligned teeth can become problematic if an opposing contact is later established. this would lead to a hypothesis that skeletal class iii malocclusions would have second molars that are supra-erupted and likely tipped. misaligned second molars can lead to occlusal interferences in the post-surgical bite. these interferences can destabilize the distal mandibular segment, jeopardizing the healing phase, negatively affect the surgical outcome, and potentially cause temporomandibular joint dysfunction. often, during surgical planning, these potential interferences will be identified and intraoperative enameloplasty can be performed. this is suboptimal; healthy tooth structure is removed, and there are significant risks of causing sensitivity, pulpal irritation, or pulpal damage. especially large interferences should only be treated via orthodontic correction, ideally prior to the orthognathic surgery. if the interferences are caught during presurgical planning, this will necessitate a delay of the operation. additionally, intrusion performed too quickly or with excessive force will create risks that include alveolar bone loss and/or periodontal defects adjacent to the intruded teeth. while the general phenomena of supraeruption have been studied, specific research examining the relative position of second molars based on skeletal malocclusion has not. the aim of this study was to investigate the relationship between the position of the maxillary second molars and the presence of an anteroposterior skeletal intermaxillary discrepancy.","{'answer_start': [1670], 'text': ['misaligned second molars can lead to occlusal interferences in the post-surgical bite']}",,clinical,"{'authors': ['Timothy P.

where is the primate space located in the maxillary arch?,"the fort johnson colony has been demonstrated as composed of biologically normal rhesus monkeys. no other detectable cause of the open bite was found except thumb and toe sucking habits. it may be surprising to find such a pronounced open bite at this young age (6-10 months old). however, it should be remembered that the rhesus monkey erupts its incisors within about a week after birth, while in humans the delayed eruption (6 months average) does not expose the maxilla to the influences of sucking habits until much later. as to the cause of the sucking habit itself, we cannot pin-point a specific factor (bottle feeding, early removal from mother, captivity, emotional disturbance, fatigue) ; however, we should mention that very few young rhesus monkeys observed under wild conditions were seen sucking their thumbs (chandler, 1960). protracted thumb sucking may, therefore, have some connection with captive life and its artificial environmental living conditions. the primate space between the upper lateral incisor and canine shows a slight increase. spacing between other anterior teeth, especially the presence of the central diastema, is very infrequent in wild living monkeys. baume and becks (50) report a primate space of about 2 mm with all the other deciduous teeth in contact. we interpret these spaces as the consequence of nonnutritive sucking habits probably augmented by tongue action associated with anterior open bite. although our computations are not conclusive, a narrowing of the maxillary dental arch and an elongation of the premaxillary dental arch appear to develop with thumb sucking. our data suggests an independence between the premaxillary and maxillary segments of the palate. however, our measurements have been taken on teeth of the dental arch and it is quite possible that the differences found reflect only tooth movement but no real skeletal changes. in order to obtain more precise information roentgenographic cephalometric films and occlusion films are now taken on the animals. in order to obtain more precise information roentgenographic cephalometric films and occlusion films are now taken on the animal.","{'answer_start': [992], 'text': ['between the upper lateral incisor and canine']}",,clinical,"{'authors': ['Daris R.

"in a patient with gingival inflammation, which type of tooth movement increases the risk of gingival recession?","current views about periodontic-orthodontic interrelationships have been summarized by vanarsdall and wennstrom. at a fundamental level, periodontal pathogenesis is strongly related to the bacterial flora and how an individual manages it (in terms of both hygiene and immune competence). because individual patients have varying susceptibility to loss of the attachment apparatus, it is important for the orthodontist to evaluate this when treatment is planned. for example, a patient with thin, friable tissue and little attached gingiva on the labial of a mandibular incisor is at risk for gingival recession if the tooth is moved facially out of its alveolar bone housing. if this labial tooth movement is accompanied by inflammation due to plaque retention there is even greater risk of recession. if the tissue is thin or if there is inadequate attached gingiva, there may be merit in prophylactically augmenting the tissue with mucogingival surgery and the placement of a split-thickness gingival graft. gingiva that has been augmented in this manner appears clinically to be more resistant to recession. tweed attempted to show with sectioned orthodontic casts that the labial plate of alveolar bone and gingiva in the mandibular incisor region becomes thinner if the incisors are moved labially, and this hypothesis was confirmed histologically in monkeys by wennstrom. no one has quantified how far labially mandibular incisors can be moved without significantly increasing the risk of recession, and obviously this would depend on the condition of the tissues initially. the anatomy of the alveolar bone and soft tissues in the area suggests that 2 to 3 mm would be the limit for most patients.","{'answer_start': [684], 'text': ['labial tooth movement']}",,clinical,"{'authors': ['James L.

"regarding the growth of the jaws, what is the relationship between the basal bone and the dentition?","there is, in normal growth processes, a harmonious correlation between the development of permanent molars and the development of the mandible and maxilla. although it is clear from the evidence that there is a harmonious relation between dental development and the growth of the jaws, it must be understood that there are two relatively independent components representing each jaw, the basal bone and the alveolar process bone. the basal bone is not dependent upon the developing dentition as it will develop even in the presence of anodontia, although it will probably not develop fully. the alveolar process bone is dependent upon the dentition for its very existence. in fact, without teeth the alveolar bone does not develop; when the teeth are lost, the alveolar bone atrophies. offers convincing evidence that the alveolar process is one component of a morphogenetic field which is composed of the tooth (cementum), the alveolar process, and the periodontal ligament. the fact that the transplanted dental papilla of hamsters will develop, once an adequate blood supply is established, suggests that there is some organizer activity associated with the developing dental papilla which has the potential of reacting on the undifferentiated mesenchymal tissue of the host or organism in such a way that the biological principle of wholeness and tissue competence is applicable to the developing tooth and its periodontium. growth in height. growth of the mandible in a vertical dimension is manifested at three sites: the alveolar process; the lower border of the mandible; and at the condylar cartilage. hunter found that deposition of alveolar bone was accompanied by the eruption of teeth. brash was convinced that a substantial amount of the total bodyheight increase took place at the alveolar border with the growth and eruption of the teeth. he observed that new bone was deposited at the base of the alveoli and on the gingival margins.","{'answer_start': [430], 'text': ['the basal bone is not dependent upon the developing dentition as it will develop even in the presence of anodontia']}",,growth,"{'authors': ['Robert H.

"regarding orthodontic bone remodeling, what is the effect of nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (nsaid) on the rate of tooth movement and osteoclasts?","in concordance with our results, jerome et al. and de carlos et al. found that celecoxib did not interfere with tooth movement. also, sandy and harris found that the nsaid inhibited the appearance of osteoclasts, but had no significant effect on tooth movement. our results are also in agreement with leonardi et al. who showed an increased expression of mmp-1, -2, -8, -9, and -13 in the pdl and alveolar bone during experimental orthodontic tooth movement in rats. also, bildt et al. reported an increased expression of mmps at the resorption side as well as the apposition side. in this study, the intensity of mmp-13 expression was milder in the three groups compared to the control group. this may be due to inhibition of cyclo-oxygenase enzyme. larkins et al. found that the expression and activation of mmps may be directly proportional to the overexpression of cox-2 in breast cancer cells. also, they confirmed that the biosynthesis of prostaglandin e2 (pge2) requires three sequential enzymatic reactions: phospholipase a2, cox-1 or cox-2, and pge2 synthesis. so, our results confirmed that administration of celecoxib to rats did not result in the reduction of the extent of root resorption. however, other studies on rats should be interpreted with caution as no human trials on immunohistochemical localization of mmp-13 have been reported so far. moreover, despite research findings, there is no standard of care for analgesic use in the pain management of orthodontic patients. apparently, the prescription of analgesics after activation of the orthodontic appliance poses a paradox: analgesics suppress the patient's pain and discomfort, but on the other hand, they reduce the effectiveness of cellular stress and inflammation during bone resorption and induced tooth movement. bone resorption induced by tooth movement is not mediated solely by prostaglandins but by a pool of mediators such as leukotrienes, cyclic adenosine monophosphate, collagenase, and many others that are generated by forces applied to periodontal tissues.","{'answer_start': [172], 'text': ['inhibited the appearance of osteoclasts, but had no significant effect on tooth movement']}",,biology,"{'authors': ['Shaza M.

how is ectopic eruption defined?,"tooth transposition occurs when adjacent teeth switch positions, particularly at the roots, or when a tooth develops or erupts in a position normally occupied by a nonadjacent tooth. the phenomenon of transposition appears to be limited to cases involving a canine and a lateral incisor or premolar, and it occurs much more commonly in the maxilla than the mandible (unilateral/bilateral). transposition of central and lateral incisors has also been described. transposition is said to be complete when the two involved teeth have fully or almost fully exchanged places. it is incomplete when the positions of the teeth are not completely exchanged but show a tendency toward such exchange. one needs to exercise caution when diagnosing transpositions to avoid confusing them with mere ectopic eruptions. in transposition, the teeth exchange places, thereby reversing their sequence in the mouth. ectopic eruption is a broad category referring to any abnormal or aberrant eruptive position taken by a tooth. transposition, therefore, must be considered a subdivision of ectopic eruption: all transpositions are examples of ectopic eruption, but few ectopic eruptions are transpositions. the etiology of transposition remains speculative. various theories have been proposed to explain the phenomenon, including transposition of dental anlage during development, migration of a tooth during eruption, heredity, and trauma. the sample for the present study consisted of 21 patients exhibiting true transposition of teeth. these patients were drawn from the 4933 patients visiting sdm college of dental sciences in dharwad, india, between august and october, 1993. all the patients where kannadigas (who lived originally in the state of karnataka, india) and none were aware of the transpositions. information was gathered to differentiate between teeth missing due to extraction and those missing due to agenesis. the following data were recorded: age at diagnosis, sex, race/ethnicity, location of transposition, and associated congenital dental anomalies with details. panoramic and iopa radiographs were taken at the examination to determine the presence of true or pseudo transpositions and congenitally missing or impacted teeth. a peg-shaped lateral incisor was defined as a severe, conical, crown-sized reduction of the tooth, and narrowing in diameter from the cervix to the incisal edge.","{'answer_start': [947], 'text': ['any abnormal or aberrant eruptive position taken by a tooth']}",,growth,"{'authors': ['Amit Chattopadhyay, BDS (Hons), DcFM, MSASMS, MDS', 'K.

what are the treatment goals for patients with cleft?,"the aims of the interdisciplinary treatment for cleft patients consist of (1) repairing the morphological alteration, (2) allowing for normal speech without loss of hearing capacity, and (3) avoiding impairment of the facial and upper dental arch growth. these requirements should be achieved without overburdening patients' families with excessive therapies that do not bring compensatory results. intercenter studies have shown that early therapeutic procedures that are added to the basic protocol of treatment do not necessarily bring advantages to the final results. sagittal deficiency of the midface, leading to a concave facial profile, is the most striking feature in adult complete unilateral cleft lip and palate patients. such a deficiency, as shown in figure 1, cannot be attributed to the cleft itself. previous reports have shown that there is some maxillary prognathism associated with upper dental protrusion in adult unoperated cleft patients. on the other hand, some studies show a deficiency of maxillary growth when comparing adult cleft patients who have been operated on at conventional times, ie, during childhood, to unoperated adult cleft patients, thus confirming the restraining effect of the repairing surgeries (figure 2). this midface deficiency, reported in many articles, is progressive and can be observed in early ages. different from the maxilla, however, growth direction and morphology of the mandible are inherent to the cleft and are not vulnerable to surgical procedures. mandibles of cleft lip and palate patients have shorter bodies and rami and more obtuse gonial angles. palate repair has been considered to be very harmful to maxillary growth. such an idea has led to protocols of treatment that include either the delay of palate repair or its performance at 2 surgical times, thus postponing the closure of the hard palate. for instance, marburg's protocol in germany advocates closure of the soft palate at 6 months of age in order to guarantee better speech and closure of the hard palate not earlier than 13 years of age on average.","{'answer_start': [74], 'text': ['(1) repairing the morphological alteration, (2) allowing for normal speech without loss of hearing capacity, and (3) avoiding impairment of the facial and upper dental arch growth']}",,pathology,"{'authors': ['Omar Gabriel da Silva Filho', 'Fabrizio Calvano', 'Antônio Guedes Alcoforado Assunção', 'Arlete de Oliveira Cavassan'], 'doi': 'https://doi.org/10.1043/0003-3219(2001)071<0274:CMICWC>2.0.CO;2', 'meta': 'Angle Orthod (2001) 71 (4): 274–284.', 'title': 'Craniofacial Morphology in Children with Complete Unilateral Cleft Lip and Palate: A Comparison of Two Surgical Protocols'}",9c1b7621-5586-4d25-acd8-26433fcf9108
what orthognathic procedures are considered problematic?,"the correction of class iii skeletal malocclusions has been one of the most difficult problems confronting orthodontics. combined orthodontic and surgical approaches appear to be the only appropriate treatment options for severe mandibular prognathism in adults. mandibular setback surgery is usually the surgical procedure of choice for most patients with severe mandibular prognathism, but the results of orthognathic surgery are frequently unstable even with rigid fixation. most relapse after orthognathic surgery seems to occur in the immediate postsurgical period. sinclair summarized the previous stability studies in 1993. according to his summary, in mandibular setback surgery the severity of the relapse is about 20% 30% of the surgical changes in the anterior direction using either wire or rigid fixation in both short- and long-term follow-up of the surgery. eggensperger et al reported on the short- and long-term skeletal changes after mandibular setback using bilateral sagittal split ramus osteotomy with rigid screw fixation. during the first postoperative year, there was a skeletal relapse of 14% of the initial skeletal setback at b-point and pogonion. bailey reported a study of stability based on the university of north carolina dentofacial database which contains over 1400 patients with at least a 1-year follow-up. according to her paper, mandibular setback surgery is one of the three procedures which can be grouped in the problematic category, which was defined as a 40% 50% chance of 2 4 mm postsurgical change and a significant chance of more than a 4-mm change. however, even with this information it is still not possible to determine which patients will show significant surgical relapse. komori reported a positive relationship between the positional changes of the proximal segment during surgery and postoperative relapse of the surgery. this is so far, one of very few studies possibly suggesting a main causative factor for the postoperative relapse of mandibular setback surgery. the purpose of this study is to determine any relationship between positional changes of the proximal segments during surgery and the positional rebound of the mandible during the postsurgical period.","{'answer_start': [263], 'text': ['mandibular setback surgery']}",,clinical,"{'authors': ['Heon Jae Cho'], 'doi': 'https://doi.org/10.2319/052306-209.1', 'meta': 'Angle Orthod (2007) 77 (5): 851–856.', 'title': 'Long-Term Stability of Surgical Mandibular Setback'}",b8b2ef35-77ee-4d48-8b5c-d71e1872f8f0
"if a single force is applied to a tooth, how can we determine the moment of the force?","orthodontic tooth movements are currently described using biomechanical newtonian mathematical models which explain tooth movement from a pure physics point of view where only two possible ways exist to apply a force system to a tooth. the first is by a single force, which in practice almost never acts through the center of resistance. therefore, a single force results in displacement of the center of resistance in the direction of the line of the force and tipping as shown in figure 1. this tendency for rotation is called the moment of the force whose magnitude is equal to the magnitude of the force multiplied by its perpendicular distance from the center of resistance of the tooth. this endows the moment of the force with a clockwise or counter-clockwise sense (direction) around a center of rotation which will always be apical to the center of resistance of the tooth. the second method by which tooth movement can be effected is through the application of a pair of equal forces which are parallel, noncolinear, and of opposite direction, termed a couple (figure 2). this system, applied anywhere on a tooth, creates only a tendency for rotation referred to as the moment of the couple whose magnitude is equal to one of the forces of the couple multiplied by the inter-force distance. the center of rotation resulting from the moment of the couple is always coincident with the center of resistance of the tooth irrespective of its point of application. connoting teeth as rigid and accepting the limitation that orthodontic forces do not act directly through the center of resistance, all appliance systems must cause tooth movement through one of these two processes, either alone or in combination. the traditional paradigm describes tooth movement as rotational (tipping) and/or translational (bodily movement), as shown in figures 1 and 3. figure 1 depicts the effect of a single force whose point of application is away from the center of resistance. this configuration causes rotation or tipping, with the center of resistance moving parallel to the line of force. the latter descriptor of tooth movement, that of translation, more complex (figure 3). here, as with rotation, the force is applied away from the center of resistance, again causing rotation or tipping. however, for to occur there must concurrently exist a couple with an opposite sense tending to tip the root in the opposite direction as the crown. under these conditions, the relative amount of crown tipping (moment of the force) and root tipping (moment of the couple) expressed at any given moment in time determines the location of an instantaneous center of rotation. when these two oppositely directed moments are equal in magnitude, the center of rotation is at infinity and tooth translation occurs (figure 3). this determinant is also expressed as the moment to force ratio.","{'answer_start': [581], 'text': ['the magnitude of the force multiplied by its perpendicular distance from the center of resistance of the tooth']}",,biomechanics,"{'authors': ['Robert J.

"regarding orthodontic appliances, for which patients is a reverse headgear of face-mask indicated?","class iii skeletal malocclusions were generally viewed as a problem of the mandible. until the 1970s, class iii and mandibular prognathism were virtually synonymous. however, a developing class iii malocclusion can include maxillary skeletal retrusion, mandibular skeletal protrusion, or a combination of both. in the skeletal class iii malocclusions, the selected treatment plan should directly reflect not only the type of class iii malocclusion but also the timing of the treatment. the chin-cup can be used to treat excessive mandibular growth and maxillary protraction can be used in treating retruded maxillae by accelerating maxillary growth in growing patients. for growing patients with skeletal class iii malocclusion characterized by maxillary retrognathism, orthopedic appliances such as reverse headgear and face mask are recommended in moderate to severe cases. treatment options for young adult and adult patients, however, include orthodontic camouflage treatment in mild to moderate cases and orthognathic surgery in moderate to severe cases. surgical treatment is more effective to eliminate skeletal problems due to maxillary retrusion. however, this treatment modality had higher risks and greater costs. therefore, if face mask treatment in young adults proved to be effective and maxillary skeletal changes could be accomplished, the disadvantages of the treatments of orthodontic camouflage and orthognathic surgery might be overcome. clinical studies indicate a limited ability to achieve a permanent reduction in the amount of mandibular growth. conversely, it is well established that sutural growth can be stimulated. for these reasons, and because relative mandibular prognathism is more often due to maxillary deficiency than mandibular excess, maxillary protraction may be the treatment of choice for the majority of the cases with class iii malocclusion. the principle of maxillary protraction is to apply tensile force on the circum-maxillary sutures and thereby stimulate bone apposition in the suture areas. one of the most important factors to consider in treating skeletal class iii patients with orthopedic force is the optimal treatment timing. early intervention facilitates growth modification, but there may be difficulty in retaining treatment effects through the growth period, necessitating long-term treatment and patient cooperation. a review of the literature reveals that greater skeletal changes with the use of the maxillary protraction appliance are possible in young patients. it has been found that in the postpubertal period there was a decrease in skeletal effect, whereas the dentoalveolar effect was increased with protraction therapy. however, some researchers reported that comparison of the treatment effect according to age showed no significant difference. therefore, the purpose of this study was to determine the skeletal, dental, and soft-tissue effects of face mask therapy and examine the effect of age on treatment response.","{'answer_start': [674], 'text': ['growing patients with skeletal class iii malocclusion characterized by maxillary retrognathism']}",,clinical,"{'authors': ['İbrahim Yavuz', 'Koray Halıcıoğlu', 'İsmail Ceylan'], 'doi': 'https://doi.org/10.2319/090308-462.1', 'meta': 'Angle Orthod (2009) 79 (5): 842–848.', 'title': 'Face Mask Therapy Effects in Two Skeletal Maturation Groups of Female Subjects with Skeletal Class III Malocclusions'}",80d7cf98-e966-43d0-8d42-f8322d4d054c
"regarding maxillary impacted canines, what is the gender difference in prevalence?","patients with impacted maxillary canines and significant resorption of the adjacent lateral incisors present the dental team with significant treatment challenges. to address these challenges effectively, it is helpful to review the literature on the etiology and incidence of both canine impaction and root resorption, especially resorption associated with impaction. treatment of a case with bilateral maxillary canine impaction and associated lateral incisor root resorption is reported. maxillary canine impaction occurs in approximately 1% to 2% of the population. females are affected approximately twice as often as males. approximately 80% to 90% of impacted canines are palatal and 10% to 20% are labial. the maxillary canine has the longest and most tortuous path of eruption, from its site of formation lateral to the piriform fossa to its final position in the arch. endocrine deficiencies, febrile diseases, and irradiation can cause general retardations in eruption, and thus can affect canine eruption. etiologic agents that may influence canines more specifically include lack of space, early loss or prolonged retention of the primary canine, abnormal position of the tooth bud, ankylosis, cystic or neoplastic formation, root dilaceration, and the iatrogenic repositioning of the adjacent lateral incisor into the canines path of eruption. palatal impactions have been associated with the absence of roots or variations in the root size of the associated maxillary lateral incisor. a genetic origin for the palatally displaced canine has also been proposed. dental crowding is more often associated with labial impactions than with palatal impactions. root resorption has been found to occur in 80% to 100% of adults, even those who have not received orthodontic treatment. orthodontic treatment is one well-documented factor in root resorption, and resorption during treatment is more likely if the teeth already show some evidence of resorption. fortunately, the resorption that is related to orthodontic treatment almost never progresses after the orthodontic forces are discontinued.","{'answer_start': [570], 'text': ['females are affected approximately twice as often as males']}",,pathology,"{'authors': ['W.

what is the most common findings in patients with class ii malocclusion?,"class ii malocclusions are characterized by an incorrect relationship between the maxillary and mandibular arches due to skeletal or dental problems or a combination of both. mandibular retrusion is its most common characteristic, with 80% of the white population displaying this trait as opposed to only 20% expressing excessive maxillary development. treatment techniques like upper premolar extractions and distalization focus on the maxillary arch in treating class ii malocclusions, whereas functional appliances are specifically used to reposition the mandible and/or the mandibular arch in an anterior direction in order to correct the same problem. the latter also includes fixed functional appliances (ffas), which are welcome aids especially when patient compliance is declining. because their primary effects are on the teeth and the adjoining dentoalveolar structures, they can be used in young adults with minimal growth. extraction of either two maxillary premolars or two maxillary and two mandibular premolars also helps in compensating a class ii malocclusion. extraction of only two maxillary premolars and anterior teeth retraction are generally indicated when there is no crowding or cephalometric discrepancy in the mandibular arch however, retracting anterior teeth in a full-cusp class ii malocclusion can be an arduous task because anchorage control becomes critical. with the introduction of skeletal anchorage, it has become possible to obtain absolute anchorage and close the extraction spaces completely by anterior tooth retraction. considering that the treatment protocols discussed above have the same treatment objectives, ie, compensation of the exaggerated overjet either by retraction of maxillary teeth or proclination/mesial movement of mandibular teeth or by a combination thereof, it would be interesting to compare the treatment differences between these techniques, as they might have a bearing on the overall treatment plan for class ii patients. the purpose of this prospective study was to examine the dentoskeletal and soft tissue treatment effects of maxillary anterior tooth retraction with mini-implant anchorage in class ii division i patients undergoing extraction of only the maxillary first premolars in comparison to similar patients undergoing treatment with a nonextraction approach using an ffa.","{'answer_start': [175], 'text': ['mandibular retrusion']}",,clinical,"{'authors': ['Madhur Upadhyay', 'Sumit Yadav', 'K.

"in class iii patient with temporomandibular joint symptoms, what is the recommended therapeutic approach?","for adult patients with class iii malocclusion, the options to treat using orthodontics alone or in combination with orthognathic surgery have been discussed for many years. previous studies indicated that the wits appraisal, gonial angle, existing temporomandibular disorders, and amount of chin deviation, especially for patients with facial asymmetry, were indicators than can help determine the treatment plan. additionally, it is necessary to consider the patient's willingness to undergo specific procedures, the patient's expectations, and facial esthetics. the initial skeletal parameters of this patient, such as lower wits appraisal ( 18.9 mm), greater gonial angle (124.8), maxilla/mandible transverse discrepancy, and mandibular asymmetry (4 mm) indicated that surgical intervention was theoretically an appropriate treatment plan. however, the patient refused the surgical approach because of the associated surgical risks. therefore, the patient was informed that mandibular prognathism and chin deviation would not be corrected by the orthodontic treatment chosen. before camouflage treatment was decided upon for the patient, she was also examined to determine if she exhibited any temporomandibular joint symptoms. skeletal asymmetry develops suboptimal occlusion, which can cause temporomandibular disorder (tmd) and encourage disc displacement. accordingly, patients with asymmetric mandibular prognathism have a higher prevalence of tmd symptoms, such as joint pain, joint clicking, and headache, compared with patients with only a protruded mandibular jaw. thus, orthognathic surgery is strongly recommended for patients with preexisting tmd. although tmd may not be cured completely, good improvement of tmd symptoms after surgery has been reported. considering that the patient did not show any signs of tmd, and the function of her posterior occlusion was acceptable, camouflage treatment with preservation of the original compensated posterior occlusion was planned. occlusion with mandibular asymmetry tends to display different inclinations between deviated and nondeviated sides. the conventional preadjusted bracket can correct the compensated dentition, which results in a successful outcome for the surgical approach. however, in the case of camouflage treatment, decompensation could be undesirable, especially if the patient shows favorable posterior occlusion despite the mandibular asymmetry, as in the case presented here. in this condition, to preserve the compensated dentition more efficiently throughout treatment, a virtual setup technique and cad/cam customized bracket system were applied.","{'answer_start': [1584], 'text': ['orthognathic surgery is strongly recommended for patients with preexisting tmd']}",,clinical,"{'authors': ['Ha Na Sha', 'Sun Young Lim', 'Sun Mi Kwon', 'Jung-Yul Cha'], 'doi': 'https://doi.org/10.2319/102318-768.1', 'meta': 'Angle Orthod (2020) 90 (4): 607–618.', 'title': 'Camouflage treatment for skeletal Class III patient with facial asymmetry using customized bracket based on CAD/CAM virtual orthodontic system:A case report'}",eaa568ec-67c0-422a-b843-21239364fb15
"regarding subjects with down syndrome (ds), what is the cause of the low sucking pressure and difficulty in sucking and swallowing during chilhood and adolescence?","because the present study analyzed the influence of breastfeeding, bottle feeding, and nonnutritive oral habits on the prevalence of malocclusion, the authors opted to adjust the logistic regression model using the following confounding and risk factors: age, mouth posture, and mother's schooling. mouth posture was measured because many individuals with ds have the habit of maintaining a mouth open position. according to a number of authors, underdevelopment of the maxilla, orbicular muscles of the lips, and facial muscles results in insufficient lip seal and can lead to mouth breathing. hypotonia of the facial and lip muscles, associated with a hypotonic, protruded tongue, causes many children/adolescents with ds to experience difficulties in sucking and swallowing. according to mizuno and ueda, sucking difficulties in infants with ds may result from the low sucking pressure and short duration, rather than a lack of will to suck. it is caused not only by hypotonicity of the perioral muscles, lips, and masticatory muscles, but also by a deficiency in smooth peristaltic-like tongue movements in the early neonatal period. sucking pressure, which is negative intraoral pressure, is generated by the lowering of the jaw and posterior depression of the tongue, which occurs during the tongue movement sequence. however, these characteristics do not impede such individuals from being able to breastfeed or having nonnutritive sucking habits. in a study carried out in japan involving children with ds and those with normal development, mizuno and ueda found significant development in the sucking behavior of the individuals with ds over time, but the sucking capacity of these infants was lower than that of normal infants.","{'answer_start': [970], 'text': ['hypotonicity of the perioral muscles, lips, and masticatory muscles, but also by a deficiency in smooth peristaltic-like tongue movements in the early neonatal period']}",,pathology,"{'authors': ['Ana Cristina Oliveira', 'Isabela Almeida Pordeus', 'Cintia Silva Torres', 'Milene Torres Martins', 'Saul Martins Paiva'], 'doi': 'https://doi.org/10.2319/072709-421.1', 'meta': 'Angle Orthod (2010) 80 (4): 748–753.', 'title': 'Feeding and nonnutritive sucking habits and prevalence of open bite and crossbite in children/adolescents with Down syndrome'}",2aaa5bbc-534a-4bc3-97fe-9123cc4fb223
"when comparing one and two-phase orthodontic treatment, what are the disadvantages of two phase orthodontic treatments?","crowding, arch constriction, and posterior crossbite were the main features of the class i malocclusion group. these features showed significant improvement following treatment with space supervision protocol and expansion appliances. kutin and hawes and clifford agreed that maxillary expansion should be initiated as early as possible to avoid any detrimental effects to the facial skeleton. early correction of class i malocclusion supports that early treatment of crowded arches and maxillary transverse discrepancy can have a beneficial effect on arch length preservation and craniofacial growth by the elimination of the functional shift. the class ii malocclusion group was characterized by skeletal and dental discrepancies and an increased overjet (>5 mm). the class ii malocclusion group comprised 43.9% of the sample (table 3). this could imply a stronger desire for early correction in the class ii malocclusion. in the present study, 64% of mean reduction of the weighted par score was seen from t0 to t1 in the class ii group. von bremen and pancherz reported a similar percentage of correction (60%) after early treatment with functional appliances in the class ii division i malocclusion evaluated by the uk par weighting system. functional jaw orthopedics with functional removable appliances is generally an accepted treatment modality in orthodontics. the results of this study addressed the changes in par scores using this treatment. although some disadvantages of the two-phase approach have been critically pointed out (increased numbers of visits, costs, and length of treatment), 15% of the patients who had the early treatment did not need more complex treatment in adolescence. vasilakou et al. reported that the class ii subjects had the least improvement during phase i treatment, which is inconsistent with the results of the present study. in their study, the total improvement of the american board of orthodontics discrepancy index scores was diminished because of the increase in incisor mandibular plane angle (impa), which occurred after early class ii correction. although the evaluation of the lower incisor position was not part of this study, siara-olds et al. found that the flaring of lower incisors caused by class ii tooth-borne functional appliances can be solved during the second phase of orthodontic treatment.","{'answer_start': [1543], 'text': ['increased numbers of visits, costs, and length of treatment']}",,clinical,"{'authors': ['Valmy Pangrazio-Kulbersh', 'He-Kyong Kang', 'Archana Dhawan', 'Riyad Al-Qawasmi', 'Rafael Rocha Pacheco'], 'doi': 'https://doi.org/10.2319/091417-618.1', 'meta': 'Angle Orthod (2018) 88 (3): 253–258.', 'title': 'Comparison of early treatment outcomes rendered in three different types of malocclusions'}",e9aee15d-26ff-4c12-9d4d-bc9686279441

"according to haas, why do class ii division ii patient have a retrusive mandible?","the objective of early treatment was not necessarily to eliminate the need for phase ii but to minimize the problems that occurred in the permanent dentition. the results of the phase i treatment turned out to be so positive that after one year not only was the transverse dimension properly corrected, but the mandible also was carried forward to its normal position, resulting in a spontaneous correction of the class ii malocclusion (figure 2g,i). no subsequent comprehensive orthodontic treatment was implemented in either the maxillary or mandibular arch. the only treatment provided for this patient was rapid palatal expansion. during the interim period, the contained jaw was able to move forward because the environment was set up for this to happen. haas noted that virtually all class ii, division 2 and most class ii, division 1 patients present mandibular functional retrusion. in the class ii, division 2 group, the retrusion was due to lingual inclination of upper central incisors. in the class ii, division 1 group, the retrusion was due to constriction of the maxillary dental arch, especially between the canines. haas emphasized that in such cases, it is important to expand the maxillary arch to obtain a permanent orthopedic effect on the maxilla by releasing the mandible to move anteriorly. class ii malocclusion is related to a deficiency in the maxillary arch width. wendling reported that rapid palatal expansion may favor a spontaneous correction of some class ii malocclusions. this procedure induces forward positioning of the mandible during the retention period (6 to 12 months after expansion) in moderate class ii cases. wendling reported that by expanding the maxillary arch, it is possible to release the mandible to move forward, thus creating an excellent condition for the mandible to grow to its full extent, helping in class ii correction. in this case report, a spontaneous correction of class ii occurred after rapid palatal expansion after the expander appliance had been stabilized. during retention, without any loss of the es, the anteroposterior discrepancy on the right side moved from a class ii to a class i molar relationship. after rapid palatal expansion, an initial downward and forward movement of the maxilla, together with a downward and backward rotation of the mandible, occur which, in fact, have a negative effect on class ii correction. during the retention period, a slight forward positioning of the mandible is observed. the expansion in the transverse dimension seems to lead to positive anteroposterior mandibular changes and to the mandible being carried forward to its normal position. all the goals of treatment in this case were achieved. the transverse, anteroposterior, and vertical dimensions appear to be properly corrected and stable, whereas posterior interdigitation, overjet, and overbite are excellent. dentofacial esthetics were markedly improved (figure 3). molar relationship at the right side achieved class i simply by a proper mandibular positioning.","{'answer_start': [926], 'text': ['the retrusion was due to lingual inclination of upper central incisors']}",,clinical,"{'authors': ['Roberto M.

"regarding growing subjects, how does juvenile rheumatoid arthritis affect craniofacial growth?","in vitro animal and human fetal studies have shown little intrinsic growth potential of secondary condylar cartilage compared with primary cartilage from epiphyseal plates. petrovic and stutzmann argued that the functional environment and action of the lateral pterygoid muscle are important in the development of condylar cartilage and, hence, the mandible. independently, this led copray et al, to conclude that local environmental factors are of importance in considering condylar growth. dolwick defined internal derangement of the temporomandibular joint (tmj) as the abnormal relationship of the articular disc to the condyle, fossa, and articular eminence, with the disc usually displaced in an anteromedial direction. since disc displacement can be seen as a loss of harmony between functional tmj components, it may be considered a local environmental disturbance with the potential to affect condylar development. juvenile rheumatoid arthritis has been shown to have a profound effect on craniofacial growth, presumably by inflammatory destruction of the condylar cartilage. altered condylar morphology or loss of normal shape, as seen on plain film radiography, has been associated with altered craniofacial morphology, although no clear cause-and-effect mechanism was postulated. patients with disc displacement without reduction show osseous changes of the condylar head, but these changes are found less frequently in patients with disc displacement with reduction. a strong relationship between disc perforation and degenerative joint disease of the temporomandibular joints has been shown, whereas the relationship between internal derangement and degenerative joint disease is less evident. internal derangement represents a less violent change in the local environment. nevertheless, disc displacement pulls the retrodiscal tissue forward between the condyle and articular eminence, with potentially harmful effects. compression of this normally vascular tissue may occur, altering oxygenation, nutrition, and lubrication of condylar tissue through synovial fluid changes. these localized changes may be adequate to alter the dynamic growth within this region, resulting in a loss of facial growth equilibrium expressed in the various adaptive growth sites. the aim of this study was to determine whether temporomandibular disc displacement is associated with specific craniofacial characteristics.","{'answer_start': [1030], 'text': ['by inflammatory destruction of the condylar cartilage']}",,pathology,"{'authors': ['B.

"in adult patients with a transverse discrepancy, what are the indications for surgically assisted rapid maxillary expansion (sarme)?","maxillary osteotomy allows expansion of the skeletal base of the maxilla. sa-rme is a true orthopedic expansion, starting at the apex of the palatal vault with bone apposition at the suture. in adult patients, the haas palatal expander also produces an orthopedic expansion, generally starting at the apical third of the lateral walls of the palate (cases 1 and 5) or midway on the lateral walls (cases 2, 3, and 4). this correction produces an increase in the volume of the palatal vault. the transverse width of the skeletal base of the maxilla may not be expanded, but transalveolar expansion can be an acceptable alternative. betts and coworkers have presented a graphic analysis of the posteroanterior cephalogram to define a maxillomandibular width differential. they state that a differential greater than 5 mm from the norm may indicate a need for surgically assisted expansion. in the present paper, the maxillary transarch widths, measured from study models, were used for comparison with the control and also to measure the expansion achieved. unfortunately pa cephalograms were not taken at the time of treatment.","{'answer_start': [785], 'text': ['a differential greater than 5 mm from the norm']}",,clinical,"{'authors': ['Chester S.

"regarding craniofacial growth anomalies, what are the causes of facial asymmetries?","severe facial asymmetry can arise from several sources, including genetic imperfections and environmental influences. hemifacial microsomia, a genetic defect, inhibits mandibular growth on the affected side. the degree of facial asymmetry depends on the degree of hypoplasia or agenesis of the tissues involved. some clefts of the lip and/or palate also result in facial asymmetry, with associated collapse of the maxillary dental arch. however, the most frequent cause of severe mandibular asymmetry may be functional ankylosis secondary to mandibular trauma at an early age. restricted mandibular movement disturbs the normal development of the maxilla and mandible in the anteroposterior and vertical in growing patients, deformities including mandibular deviation and canted occlusal plan often develop progressively until growth stops. for patients who have suffered condylar fractures, early orthopedic treatment is indicated to encourage subsequent condylar and soft tissue growth. a hybrid functional appliance is known to be effective in preventing the worsening of deformities and, in some cases, correcting them. the hybrid appliance is designed to encourage growth on the affected side. treatment success, however, depends on the severity of the damaged tissue. if condylar translation is restricted, surgical release of the ankylosis or the scar is necessary prior to the orthopedic treatment, otherwise the condyle will not respond to if the facial asymmetry develops progressively during orthopedic treatment, surgical reconstruction of the temporomandibular joint with a costochondral graft or the remaining ramus tissue might be considered. if the patient has finished growing, skeletal deformities are corrected by a combined surgical-orthodontic treatment or camouflage orthodontic treatment.","{'answer_start': [66], 'text': ['genetic imperfections and environmental influences']}",,pathology,"{'authors': ['Takashi Yamashiro, DDS, PhD', 'Takumi Okada, DDS', 'Kenji Takada, DDS, PhD'], 'doi': 'https://doi.org/10.1043/0003-3219(1998)068<0085:CRFAAE>2.3.CO;2', 'meta': 'Angle Orthod (1998) 68 (1): 85–90.', 'title': 'Case Report: Facial asymmetry and early condylar fracture'}",a35c20d8-dec9-4fa3-98ca-5d199090ee7f
what is the effect of microetching on enamel?,"assessment of the effectiveness or safety of rotary instruments is limited to inspecting the surface under sem to reveal the topography and morphology of the enamel surface. in this study, sem was used to give a better understanding of what happens to enamel with the different methods of resin removal tested. nonetheless, sem lacks a quantitative scale, cannot be used for the comparative assessment, and provides only subjective information. the earliest studies relating the effects of debonding on the enamel surface were conducted by newman and facq. brown and way suggested that there was less enamel loss in the clinic than in vitro because the destructive removal is more extensive in vitro. in this study, the tcb was very efficient in residual resin cleanup. sem photographs clearly demonstrate that the enamel scarring was inevitable with both low- and high-speed tcb (figures 1 and 2). using a tcb with high speed seems to be a very efficient way to clean the surface and the least time consuming (table 4), but it was the most hazardous procedure to the enamel (figure 2). when tcb are used at high speed, they can cause damage to enamel because they are harder than the enamel. van waes et al and zachrisson and rtun concluded that a tcb at low speed produced the finest scratch pattern with the least enamel loss of 7.4 m. retief and denys recommended the use of tcb at high speed with adequate air cooling, whereas rouleau et al and campbell2 suggested water spray instead of air cooling. in this study, air cooling was preferred to water cooling to assist in the observation of the resin remnants. remnant removal with sof-lex aluminum oxide finishing discs showed a progressive decrease in surface irregularities but was the most time-consuming method (table 4) and left too much remnant on the enamel surface (figure 3). the result was consistent with other authors. campbell found that discs and rubber wheels are effective, but these may be cumbersome for clinicians. microetching results in an irreversible loss of enamel by removal of both organic and inorganic components of the enamel matrix. sem photographs showed different surface patterns at different magnifications. the enamel seemed smooth at 300 , but at 1500 magnification revealed deep pits (figure 4), which may be the possible cause of the lower rebond strength found in this group (table 3). this finding is consistent with reports of smooth surfaces after microetching at 500 magnification. throughout the first debonding, the brackets of the experimental groups were debonded by pliers to mimic in vivo debonding conditions and to ensure that the surfaces and their sem evaluations would represent clinically debonded surfaces. however, in the control group, the sbs for the initial debonding was measured using the universal test machine to compare the data obtained from the experimental groups for the second debonding.","{'answer_start': [2017], 'text': ['irreversible loss of enamel by removal of both organic and inorganic components of the enamel matrix']}",,materials,"{'authors': ['Neslihan Eminkahyagil', 'Ayca Arman', 'Alev Çetinşahin', 'Erdem Karabulut'], 'doi': 'https://doi.org/10.1043/0003-3219(2006)076[0314:EORMOE]2.0.CO;2', 'meta': 'Angle Orthod (2006) 76 (2): 314–321.', 'title': 'Effect of Resin-removal Methods on Enamel and Shear Bond Strength of Rebonded Brackets'}",0cf2edb6-da9c-4e00-8ae2-0c267c88b14b
"in patients with periodontal bone loss, how is the center of resistance (cres) affected?","contrary to the above study,18 our results suggest that lingual force application may produce much more complicated and unpredictable tooth movement in terms of intrusion and extrusion. this conflict can be explained because the authors did not refer to different incisor inclinations or to a different bracket base thickness. where bone level is reduced, the center of resistance (cres) moves apically, and the distance between the point of force application (pf) and cres increases, resulting in higher moments. marginal bone loss increases the moment-to-force ratio (m/f) required for translation at 65% of bone loss (m/f increases by 0.65 mm for every 1 mm of bone loss). application of an intrusion force in cases of reduced bone level with a labial bracket creates counterclockwise moments that are larger than in normal cases because of the greater distance between the pf and the cres (figure 6). therefore, the crown moves more labially. with a lingual bracket, different root moments are created depending on the initial tooth position, as described previously. the transitional point at which pure intrusion movement is created (without any labial or lingual movement of the crown) is smaller than in normal cases and depends on the bone level as well as on tooth inclination and bracket width. moments created with a lingual bracket as compared with a labial bracket are always smaller, with less side effects of proclination or retroclination of the crown. when the bone level is reduced and the incisors are proclined, the counterclockwise moments developed with intrusive forces are smaller than those developed with the labial bracket. there is also less labial crown movement (figure 7).","{'answer_start': [356], 'text': ['the center of resistance (cres) moves apically']}",,biomechanics,"{'authors': ['Silvia Geron, DMD, MSc', 'Rafi Romano, DMD, MSc', 'Tamar Brosh, PhD'], 'doi': 'https://doi.org/10.1043/0003-3219(2004)074<0195:VFILAL>2.0.CO;2', 'meta': 'Angle Orthod (2004) 74 (2): 195–201.', 'title': 'Vertical Forces in Labial and Lingual Orthodontics Applied on Maxillary Incisors—A Theoretical Approach'}",5e5400ff-dcd7-4be8-9e09-7ed08312459d
"regarding cephalometric analysis, what is the wits appraisal?","an alternative measurement based on a linear evaluation of the distance between points a and b projected onto the occlusal plane is termed the wits analysis. the wits value, or ao-bo, is the linear measurement between the perpendiculars drawn from point a and point b to the functional occlusal plane. while the wits analysis has been shown to be less affected by variations in craniofacial physiognomy, variation of the occlusal plane may affect the wits appraisal. to reduce the depenclence of sagittal measurements on the functional occlusal plane (fop), chang advocated a linear measurement of the distance between points a and b projected onto the frankfort horizontal plane (figure 1). the points of origin of the perpendiculars on the frankfort horizontal plane projected to points a and b were labeled af and bf, respectively, and the measurement between the points along fh was called the af-bf distance. since the introduction of this measurement, only two authors have reported norms based on differing populations (table 1). because a large proportion of orthodontic patients in the united states are caucasian children and adults, the need exists to report af-bf standards for these groups. the purpose of this study was threefold: to estimate the af-bf values for a caucasian american population, to evaluate the relative stability of these values during growth, and to compare this indicator with anb values.","{'answer_start': [187], 'text': ['the linear measurement between the perpendiculars drawn from point a and point b to the functional occlusal plane']}",,clinical,"{'authors': ['David L.

"in an ideal orthodontic thermoelastic nitinol wire, what is the desired transition temperature range (ttr)?","the unique memory property of thermodynamic wire is only partially understood, but it is believed to result from the alloys inherent capability to alter its atomic bonding forces as a function of this shape recovery phenomenon is the result of a transition in crystal structure (atomic and electron shifts) that occurs by deformation and cooling. upon reversing the transition by heating, the structure reverts to its higher temperature form, accompanied by abrupt changes in properties. amazingly, this is a reversible process. an ideal thermodynamic nitinol wire would have the following characteristics: 1) dead soft at room temperature so that it can be tied easily, 2) instantaneously activated by the heat of the mouth, 3) able to apply clinically acceptable orthodontic forces that would result in tooth movement, 4) once fully activated, would not be affected further by increased heat in the mouth, and 5) a fairly narrow ttr, it should be completely active at mouth temperatures yet completely passive at lower temperatures. this property would allow the clinician sufficient time to tie the archwire into the bracket slots before the heat of the mouth activates the wire.","{'answer_start': [915], 'text': ['a fairly narrow ttr']}",,materials,"{'authors': ['Samir E.

"for teenage patient requiring maxillary expansion, what was the rate rapid expansion reported in the study?","the extraoral appliance used in this study was a kloehn cervical headgear recommended to be worn for 12 to 14 hours per day. the force applied for the 70 patients averaged 450 g. the patients were seen monthly when attention was given to three areas of adjustment: (1) the inner bow was maintained at a 4 to 8 mm expansion; (2) the outer bow was maintained at a 10 to 20 elevation to prevent distal tipping of the molars, and (3) the ends of the inner bow were adjusted to rotate the molars. all palatal expanders were manufactured at the same clinic. the expansion rate was two quarter turns (0.5 mm) per day until adequate overexpansion was achieved when the lingual cusps of the upper posterior teeth approximated the buccal cusps of the lower posterior teeth as determined by clinical observation. the rme appliance was left cemented in place for 3 9 months while extraoral traction was applied against the maxilla. a loose removable acrylic plate was placed within 48 hours of removing the expander. each patient wore the acrylic plate for a variable amount of time, usually one year. in the lateral cephalometric radiographs, the degree of image distortion was determined using a 100 mm correction ruler adapted to the patient, on the midsagittal plane. kodak t-mat film (20.3 25.4 cm) was used and placed on the left side of the cephalostat, to avoid image enlargement beyond 8% in relation to the structures. cephalometric points were digitized (numonics corp, model accugrid xnt a30bl, montgomeryville, pa), according to ortho lateral regimen and processed with dentofacial planner plus software, version 2.5b (dentofacial software inc, toronto, ontario, canada). the angular measurements included sna (maxillary protrusion) and sn-pp (maxillary inclination). to evaluate the reproducibility of the present research in determining the cephalometric points, preliminary tests were performed to determine the errors in the method employed. eleven randomly chosen lateral cephalograms were digitized at predetermined intervals (minimum two weeks) between the first and the second. the largest error was 0.8 and the smallest was 0.1.","{'answer_start': [575], 'text': ['two quarter turns (0.5 mm) per day']}",,clinical,"{'authors': ['Roberto M.

"regarding changes in arch dimension, what is the difference in arch length in boys between age 8 and 13?","in the present sample, the children who had lost a deciduous canine had shorter total arch lengths compared with the children with remaining deciduous canines. there were no differences in anterior arch widths between these 2 groups. there were no differences in the available space or overjet between these groups. this means that during loss of the deciduous canine, the permanent incisors drift distally and, if at all, to a lesser extent laterally. the distance between the permanent lateral incisors has been registered longitudinally from the mean age of 9.4 years to the mean age of 25.9 years. this distance decreases both in the maxilla and in the mandible from the age of 9 years. it is a common practice in some cases of anterior crowding to extract deciduous canines. loss of deciduous canines before 9 years of age is mainly due to space problems and seldom due to caries. in cases of impacted maxillary canines, extraction of the deciduous canine is recommended, but this is at the age of 10 years or older. this study showed that the group with the early loss of a deciduous canine had shorter arches. this could perhaps diminish the arches to a greater extent than if early loss of a deciduous canine had not occurred. the normal difference between 8 and 13 years of age is an increase in arch length in the maxilla of 1 mm in boys and 0.7 mm in girls. in the mandible, the arch length decreases by 2.4 mm in boys and by 3.2 mm in girls between 8 and 13 years of age. these values were calculated by using arch length from the mesial surface of the first permanent molar to the first permanent molar with the distal surface of canines and the mesial surface of incisors. this means that during this period, when these teeth are normally lost, there is no decrease in maxillary arch perimeter. the present investigation found a shorter total arch perimeter in the maxilla for the children who had loss of a deciduous canine. this is indirect evidence that children who lose their deciduous maxillary canines early have shorter arches. early loss of deciduous canines was also significantly associated with wider teeth mesiodistally for the girls. in the mandible, the arches in children with loss of a deciduous canine were also shorter, but these values were in the range of normal changes for these age-groups. the same conclusion can, therefore, not be drawn for the mandible concerning the loss of a deciduous canine on the basis of these assumptions. in a study on the effect of early loss of deciduous molars, the group with crowding at 15 years of age was compared with the group without crowding at 15 years of age. in the groups who had not lost their deciduous molars prematurely, the maxillary arch perimeter was 77.2 mm in the uncrowded group and 73.1 mm in the crowded group.","{'answer_start': [1386], 'text': ['the arch length decreases by 2.4 mm in boys']}",,growth,"{'authors': ['Rune Lindsten, DDS', 'Björn Ögaard, DrOdont, DDS', 'Erik Larsson, DrOdont, DDS'], 'doi': 'https://doi.org/10.1043/0003-3219(2001)071<0036:ASRALI>2.0.CO;2', 'meta': 'Angle Orthod (2001) 71 (1): 36–43.', 'title': 'Anterior Space Relations and Lower Incisor Alignment in 9-Year-Old Children Born in the 1960s and 1980s'}",102ccd97-9a4f-456d-b90a-c4c54ff83380
what is the regional acceleratory phenomenon (rap)?,"reduction of orthodontic therapy time is considered to be an important goal in the management of malocclusions. corticotomy has been proposed as an alternative to conventional orthodontic treatment in difficult adult cases for rapid tooth movement. in the present case, corticotomy-facilitated lower incisor retraction was accomplished in 1.5 months. chung et al reported that the complete retraction of anterior teeth combined with corticotomy in a case with severe bimaxillary protrusion took less than 3.5 months. according to the clinical observations of d ker, the required position of the teeth after corticotomy could be achieved even earlier than 1.5 3 months. in the current case report, the total orthodontic treatment time (16 months) was dramatically reduced when compared with the average treatment time for extraction therapy (31 months). in corticotomy-facilitated orthodontics, the reduction of orthodontic treatment time by approximately 50% was observed. the earlier concept of the rapid tooth movement was based on bony block movement in corticotomy techniques including buccal and lingual vertical and subapical horizontal cuts circumscribing the roots of the teeth. according to suya, the tooth embedded within a block of medullary bone served as the handle by which the bands of less-dense medullary bone surrounding the teeth were moved block by block. on the other hand, the latest concept on the rapid tooth movement after corticotomy is supported by the regional acceleratory phenomenon (rap), described as accelerated bone turnover and decreased regional bone density. the rap mechanism potentiating tissue healing was shown to occur in the mandible as well as in long bones. wilcko et al presented cases treated in approximately 6 months with combined corticotomy-facilitated orthodontics and periodontal alveolar augmentation called accelerated osteogenic orthodontics. in most of their nonextraction cases, both labial and lingual vertical and subapical corticotomies and selective decortification were performed and a bone-augmentation procedure was added to protect the periodontium during expansive tooth movements. in an attempt to clarify the mode of tooth movement after corticotomy, pre- and posttreatment computed tomography (ct) scans were compared, and the findings indicated a demineralization-remineralization phenomenon rather than a bony block movement. because the ct scans or histolologic findings were not available in the present case treated with our corticotomy technique, it was not likely to definitely state the nature of tooth movement. however, the rapid tooth movement seemed to mostly depend on rap rather than bony block movement because the lingual cortical bone was left intact and bone blocks surrounding teeth were not formed. furthermore, labial vertical cuts, which were deepened into the spongiosa reaching lingual cortical bone, might help rap diffuse in the mandibular anterior region and in the lingual cortical bone. the wounding of the lingual cortical bone to stimulate rap was performed from the labial side in contrast to the two-sided corticotomies.","{'answer_start': [1533], 'text': ['accelerated bone turnover and decreased regional bone density']}",,biology,"{'authors': ['Derya Germeç', 'Bahadir Giray', 'Ilken Kocadereli', 'Ayhan Enacar†'], 'doi': 'https://doi.org/10.1043/0003-3219(2006)076[0882:LIRWAM]2.0.CO;2', 'meta': 'Angle Orthod (2006) 76 (5): 882–890.', 'title': 'Lower Incisor Retraction with a Modified Corticotomy'}",a30d0e6f-85b8-47fb-817b-3f064ef919d6
"in primary dentition, what are the types of terminal plane relationships?","as previously reported, epidemiological studies dealing with the sagittal arrangement of the jaws (dental arches) suggest certain racial (african american vs european) differences in the distribution of the occlusal relationships in human dentitions, especially the permanent dentition. theories regarding the mechanisms of occlusal development in the permanent dentition begin at the terminal plane of the completed primary dentition. along with greater emphasis on prevention and early treatment, increased focus has been directed at classification of occlusal development in the primary dentition (table 1). few studies of the primary dentition and occlusal development of african american children have been undertaken, and none have quantified (metrically) the types of terminal plane relationships in this population. classification of occlusion in the permanent dentition describes the sagittal relationship of the buccal surfaces of the maxillary and mandibular first molars. in the primary dentition, classification is routinely based on the anteroposterior distance-terminal plane difference (apd-tpd, figure 1) between the distal surfaces of the opposing primary maxillary and mandibular second molars. investigations have focused on the types of terminal plane relationships in the primary dentition in an effort to forecast occlusal relationships in the permanent dentition. zigmond, and later chapman, observed that in the occluded primary dentition the distal surfaces of the maxillary and mandibular second molars were approximately coincidental (flush terminal plane) and that some adjustment mechanism must occur if the accessional permanent first molars are to occlude correctly (class i) upon eruption. friel suggests that the coincidental nature of the opposing primary maxillary and mandibular second molars is due to the differential mesiodistal crown width of the teeth, the mandibular second molar being wider than the maxillary second molar causing a flush terminal plane. anderson observed different posterior sagittal (maxillary over mandibular) primary tooth size ratios between african american (0.96) and european (0.94) children and hypothesized possible population differences in terminal plane depth (tpd) relationships. other interracial and intraracial investigations of terminal plane relationships recorded wide variations in the frequency of the various classifications (mesial step, distal step, and flush) as summarized in table 1. this is especially true for the flush terminal plane (range 29% to 80%), the type most often cited as the norm for the primary dentition. the aim of this investigation was to quantify and compare the types and depths of terminal plane relationships observed on casts of the completed primary dentitions of african american and european children employing the same methodology.","{'answer_start': [2410], 'text': ['mesial step, distal step, and flush']}",,anatomy,"{'authors': ['Arnett A.

"regarding the growth analysis using cephalometric radiographs, what structure is used for the superimposition of the maxilla?","in this study, the total change in the position of point a was investigated by superimposing the pretreatment and postproclination cephalograms on the sn line at the sella. from the sn line, horizontal and vertical reference lines were drawn. the horizontal reference line was drawn 7 degrees at the sn line to simulate natural head position, and the vertical reference line was drawn from the sella perpendicular to the horizontal reference line. to differentiate local changes in the position of point a from total changes, superimposition on maxillary structures was performed. unfortunately, the maxilla is subjected to extensive periosteal remodeling, and no really satisfactory stable sites are available for superimposition. bjork and skieller studied movements of metallic implants inserted as markers in the jaws of children and found that the anterior surface of the zygomatic process of the maxilla undergoes little periosteal remodeling with growth. this structure is not always easily seen on a lateral radiograph. during this study, it was not always possible to determine the anterior contour of the zygomatic process. therefore, the bolton template of maxillary superimposition based primarily on the anterior palatal contour was used instead. total changes in the position of point a, relative to the cranial base, were in a forward and downward direction; point a moved 0.46 mm anteriorly and 0.84 mm in a downward direction (table 1). these findings are coincident with those of bjork and skieller, who found that the maxilla grows downward, forward, and outward during childhood.","{'answer_start': [1213], 'text': ['the anterior palatal contour']}",,growth,"{'authors': ['Kazem S.

"regarding nickel-titanium alloys, how do thermoelastic wires behave once inserted in the mouth?","thermoelastic nitinol the third nitinol-type alloy on the market today is a martensitic active alloy that ultimately exhibits a thermally induced sme (figure 5). this is the long-awaited nitinol alloy that dr. andreasen hoped to someday employ in orthodontics. for many years the alloy composition simply could not be controlled precisely enough to make a uniform wire product. transition temperatures from martensite to austenite had to occur in the region of ambient oral temperature, and yet it was known that for every 150 parts per million (ppm) variation in composition, a 1c change in the transition temperature occurred (figure 3). after a 20 year hiatus, miura showed that surgical cases could be treated by preparing a series of arches in which the desired shape was set by heat. upon distortion and insertion into the mouth, the appliance would be activated by the warmth of the oral cavity and return to its predetermined shape. by capitalizing on thermoelasticity, a series of final arch forms could be generated, and thereby the practitioner could maintain control. using these alloys, major medical advances have been made in the peoples republic of china for the treatment of scoliosis. in this procedure a patient has precooled shape memory rods implanted in his or her back, following which the body heat warms the rods over a period of a few hours, and the spine is gradually straightened. in the next few years orthodontists will hopefully achieve similar dramatic results by reducing undesirable effects (such as round-tripping) and consequently adapt and control shape memory alloys for the routine treatment of malposed teeth. today, the thermoelastic effect is demonstrated in gac international's alloy, sentalloy light.","{'answer_start': [836], 'text': ['the appliance would be activated by the warmth of the oral cavity and return to its predetermined shape']}",,materials,"{'authors': ['Robert P.

"regarding the esthetics of smiles, what is a high smile line?","one of the most important aspects of dental and facial esthetics is the vertical anterior tooth display. esthetic judgment is made by viewing the patient from the front in dynamic states like conversation, facial expressions, and smiling. tjan and miller in a study of the full smiles of 454 students, aged 20 30 years, divided the smile line into three types: a high smile line, revealing the complete maxillary incisors and a continuous band of the gingiva; an average smile, revealing 75 100% of the maxillary incisors; and a low smile, revealing less than 75% of the maxillary incisors. the high smile line, defined as gingival smile line (gsl) or gummy smile (gs), commonly provokes strong concern from clinicians. orthodontists and surgeons are conditioned to see a gs as esthetically undesirable. treatment alternatives of gs include various combinations of orthodontics periodontal and surgical therapy, depending on the diagnosis of the gs. because the effective correction of excessive gingival display is not a conservative orthodontic treatment, but a combined interdisciplinary treatment,5 7 or sometimes an invasive surgical procedure, the most important factor to be considered is whether the gs should be treated or not. as peck and peck claimed we orthodontists tend to forget that facial esthetics is a subject that interests all people everywhere, and the ultimate source of esthetic values should be the people and not just ourselves. the gs is not necessarily unesthetic in the eyes of the public. many actors, models, and beauty contestants, especially women, expose gingival tissue at smile and are still considered beautiful people with beautiful smiles. kokich et al used female smiles and found that lay people were unable to detect an incisal plane tilting until it was three mm, and gingival exposure was classified as noticeable unattractive only at four mm. the dilemma whether to treat the gs or not is further emphasized by the effect of aging on gingival display. the lip coverage of the maxillary incisors tends to increase with age, and high smiles will normally diminish with age. therefore, the gsl may be considered a youthful characteristic. the increased lip coverage of the upper incisors with age improves the smile esthetics of individuals with gsl while deteriorating the oral esthetics of intermediate or low smile lines creating less exposure of the incisors and an older appearance. the effect of aging on the lower gingival display is the opposite, with the lower gingival display increasing with age. another aspect of the dilemma of treating gsl is the probable sex difference. according to van der geld and van waas's literature search, it appears that the smile line was, on average, situated higher among women than among men. a social aspect of the gsl subject that has not been studied yet is a possible difference between men and women in the perception of oral esthetics of each of the two sexes. therefore, the purpose of this study is to compare the perception of oral esthetics of men and women, during smile and speech, evaluated by men and women lay evaluators, in different gingival display situations above upper incisors and below lower incisors and in different angles of incisor plane inclination.","{'answer_start': [380], 'text': ['revealing the complete maxillary incisors and a continuous band of the gingiva']}",,clinical,"{'authors': ['Silvia Geron', 'Wasserstein Atalia'], 'doi': 'https://doi.org/10.1043/0003-3219(2005)75[778:IOSOTP]2.0.CO;2', 'meta': 'Angle Orthod (2005) 75 (5): 778–784.', 'title': 'Influence of Sex on the Perception of Oral and Smile Esthetics with Different Gingival Display and Incisal Plane Inclination'}",fa4113e0-5481-4a27-b2ba-5e7466e297a0
"in cephalometric analysis, which landmarks can be used for mandibular superimposition?","mandibular superimposition on stable, naturally occurring structures also has gained wide acceptance. these techniques include superimposition on outline of the inferior border of the mandible and along the mandibular plane, as well as bj rk's and ricketts' structural methods. based on serial studies of implant subjects and patients, bj rk observed that the mandibular canal, the developing molar crypts, and the inner cortical structure of the inferior border of the symphysis could be reasonable substitutes for mandibular implant superimposition. the mandibular superimposition method advocated by the abo is to register on the internal cortical outline of the symphysis with the best fit on the mandibular canal to assess mandibular tooth movement and incremental growth of the mandible. the current study assumes that the implant method is the most accurate method of superimposition to determine growth and treatment changes in the maxilla and mandible. therefore, the primary purpose of this investigation is to test the hypothesis that there is no difference between the information produced by superimposition of serial lateral headfilms on anatomical structures and that produced by superimposition on metallic implants according to the protocols developed by bj rk. this evaluation is based on the analysis of maxillary and mandibular growth data gathered from the cephalograms available at the six consecutive stages of cervical vertebral maturation and superimposed on metallic implants located within the maxilla and mandible. cervical vertebral staging was selected because the rates of growth and remodeling are known to vary over time, with the maximum growth velocity occurring during the cs-cs4 interval in most individuals.22,23 by evaluating a subject longitudinally both before and after the peak in mandibular growth velocity, patterns of mandibular growth and remodeling can be determined.","{'answer_start': [356], 'text': ['the mandibular canal, the developing molar crypts, and the inner cortical structure of the inferior border of the symphysis']}",,growth,"{'authors': ['Yan Gu', 'James A.

"regarding indicators of skeletal maturity, is the cvm method reliable?","one of the obvious solutions to this problem is to establish stable, artificial reference points within the mandible. the classic studies of bj rk and coworkers provided the first insights as to the pattern of craniofacial growth in humans through the analysis of serial cephalograms on metallic implants in the craniofacial complex. since that time, the use of metallic implants as reference points in longitudinal cephalometric investigations unfortunately has been exceedingly rare, with most studies conducted two or more decades ago. degaard produced two papers on the growth and development of the mandible, with special emphasis on mandibular rotation during growth. lavergne and gasson also published an investigation on mandibular growth rotation based on the bergen material. only a few clinical studies of orthodontic treatment have been conducted, including an early investigation of rapid maxillary expansion by krebs. later, breiden and coworkers evaluated the transverse changes produced by the fr-2 appliance of fr nkel also by way of metallic implants placed in the maxilla. dr j. rodney mathews and colleagues at the university of california san francisco were one of the few groups to conduct a longitudinal growth study similar to that of bj rk and coworkers. from series of cephalograms taken annually, mathews and ware described the growth direction of the mandible. subsequently, mathews and payne published a study of changes in lower incisor position over time. baumrind and coworkers also published a series of papers after further investigation of the films in the mathews and ware sample with the aim of describing maxillary and mandibular growth changes. one of the themes emerging in orthodontics today that generally was not of as much interest three or four decades ago is the issue of treatment timing, with the maturational stage of the individual assuming increased importance in contemporary diagnosis and treatment planning. a variety of biologic indicators have been used over the years to evaluate skeletal maturity, including increases in body height, maturation of the bones in the hand and wrist, dental development and eruption, menarche and voice changes, as well as the maturation of the cervical vertebrae. during the past several years, the relationship between the stages of cervical vertebral maturation (cvm) and mandibular growth has received increasing attention, with the cvm method shown to be effective and clinically reliable for the appraisal of mandibular skeletal maturation in growing children. fortunately, the longitudinal cephalometric records of subjects in the mathews and ware implant study again have been made available for evaluation. in the current study, the analysis of subjects in whom tantalum implants have been placed is combined with recent information on cervical vertebral maturation. therefore, the primary purpose of this paper is to evaluate the mandibular growth changes from cephalometric superimpositions on metallic implants located within the mandible at six consecutive stages of cervical vertebral maturation (cs1 through cs6) and superimposed on metallic implants located within the mandible. both changes in overall dimension and regional growth and remodeling of the mandible will be examined.","{'answer_start': [2421], 'text': ['the cvm method shown to be effective and clinically reliable for the appraisal of mandibular skeletal maturation in growing children']}",,growth,"{'authors': ['Yan Gu', 'James A.

"regarding the findings of the study on patient with cleft lip and/or palate, what was the prevalence of hypodontia of the maxillary permanent lateral incisors?","the present study revealed a prevalence of 77% hypodontia in the children with cleft lip, cleft palate, or both examined, excluding third molars. this frequency was statistically higher than the 1.6% to 9.6% reported for a noncleft population, and considerably higher than the 45.5% previously reported for children with cleft lip and palate. hypodontia of the maxillary permanent lateral incisors, observed in 74% in our total cleft sample, was significantly higher than the 2.2% reported for the normal population, or the 56.9% previously reported for children with cleft lip and palate. similarly, a finding of 18% missing second premolars found in children with cleft lip and palate was considerably higher than the 3.4%9 to 6.6% found in children without clefts. this was only slightly lower than the 24% missing second premolars reported for children with cleft lip and palate. the sample population in the reported studies were more homogenous than ours, which was of varied racial and ethnic origin. this could possibly explain these differences. the considerably higher prevalence of hypodontia of both maxillary lateral incisors and maxillary and mandibular second premolars in the entire cleft sample; a total of 339 teeth missing from the maxillary and mandibular arches, is reported (table 2). the great majority of missing teeth was from the maxilla. there were 269 missing lateral incisors, of which 259 were on the cleft side and 10 on the noncleft side. the difference was statistically significant (p = .000001). in addition, 47 second premolars were missing in the maxillary arch, of which 35 were on the cleft side and 12 on the noncleft side. in addition, 23 second premolars were absent in the mandible, of which 18 were on the cleft side and 5 on the noncleft side (table 2). it is evident that the cleft side, which is found in a substantially higher incidence on the left side, presents considerably more missing second premolars than the noncleft side (p = .037). this is true both in the maxilla and the mandible (53 and 17, respectively; table 2). in fact, hypodontia was found an order of magnitude more frequently on the cleft side than on the noncleft side (312 and 27, respectively). similarly, substantially more missing teeth were detected in the maxillary cleft side (259 lateral incisors and 35 second premolars), compared with its antimere noncleft side (10 lateral incisors and 12 second premolars, table 2).","{'answer_start': [411], 'text': ['74%']}",,pathology,"{'authors': ['Yehoshua Shapira, DMD', 'Erwin Lubit, DDS', 'Mladen M.

"if a patient has over 9 mm of crowding, what is the severity of the crowding?","the appropriate therapy for dental crowding varies according to the magnitude of the problem. according to little et al., this therapy may involve follow-up to develop and correct the occlusion. however, this is not always the case, and correction may occur spontaneously in patients with slight crowding (up to 2 mm); cases of severe crowding (>9 mm) may require more extensive therapy with tooth extractions. severe crowding caused by tooth size arch length deficiency (tsald) may be treated at an early stage with serial tooth extractions in the early mixed dentition (first transitory period) or with late extraction of the premolars in the permanent dentition. the classic procedure of early treatment with the protocol of serial extractions has involved removal of the primary canines and finally; followed by later removal of the permanent the first premolars. therefore, the goal of extraction in both time intervals is to create space to enable the correct alignment and leveling of the teeth in basal bone. the ideal time for the beginning of orthodontic treatment has always been a subject of controversy; the factors that most frequently favor early treatment are that it is easy to perform, and its cost, duration, and stability are better vs late treatment. this was also the opinion of 159 orthodontists of the american board of orthodontics, who said that treatment performed at an early stage enables improved control of growth; increases the patient's self-esteem and parents' satisfaction; presents better and more stable results; diminishes the extent of treatment needed for the permanent dentition, when necessary; and causes less damage to the periodontal tissues and tooth enamel. many authors have written about the subject expressing the same optimistic trend toward early treatment with regard to clinical efficacy, reduction in mechanotherapy, and increase in stability. however, their affirmations were based on professional experience and case reports only. therefore, by means of a systematic review, the aim of this research was to answer the following focused question: for patients with severe crowding caused by tsald, are the occlusal and secondary outcomes of treatment with early first premolar extraction equivalent to those obtained with late treatment?","{'answer_start': [328], 'text': ['severe crowding']}",,clinical,"{'authors': ['Hibernon Lopes Filho', 'Lúcio H.

"in patients with cleft lip and palate (clp), what is an alternative method to le fort i maxillary advancement that can be used to treat maxillary hypoplasia?","[new] :: maxillary hypoplasia is a common deformity in repaired cleft lip and palate (clp) patients. this hypoplasia is related to a combination of congenital reduction in midfacial growth and the surgical scar from the repair of the cleft palate. about 25% of these patients require orthognathic surgery for the correction of this deformity. le fort i maxillary advancement offers significant improvement in terms of esthetic, functional, and psychosocial benefits. however, this immediate surgical advancement can trigger or worsen velopharyngeal insufficiency (vpi), which is one of the most important problems affecting speech in clp patients. recently, distraction osteogenesis (do) has been recognized as a widely accepted method to correct maxillary hypoplasia in clp patients, with predictable and stable results. do aids in prevention of velopharyngeal deterioration after maxillary advancement, in addition to enhancing bone stability, where slow movement of the maxillary bone allows the surrounding soft tissues as the facial envelop, soft palate, and pharynx to adapt to the structural changes and reduce skeletal relapse. changes in speech and velopharyngeal function (vpf) after maxillary distraction have been detailed in a few studies and have yielded different results. some investigators have reported vpf deterioration in 14% and 16.7% of their patients after maxillary distraction. they identified the degree of distraction at which vpf is compromised as 15 mm. another study reported that the deterioration of hypernasality was not always proportional to the amount of advancement. it depended on the position of the posterior pharyngeal wall and the rotation of the palatal plane. therefore, the impact of do on the status of the velopharynx remains unclear, and the question of a possible correlation between degree of maxillary advancement and velopharyngeal deterioration remains unanswered. the aim of this study was to evaluate early and late velopharyngeal changes in clp patients after using of a rigid external distractor (red) and to correlate these changes to the amount of maxillary advancement.","{'answer_start': [658], 'text': ['distraction osteogenesis (do)']}",,pathology,"{'authors': ['Mahasen Taha', 'Yasser M.

"regarding the segmented arch technique for space closure, what is the require moment to force ratio (m/f) to achieve tipping movements?","orthodontists accomplish space closure in different ways, depending on the diagnosis and treatment plan. frictionless systems of space closure are superior to systems which introduce friction as a means of space closure. an appliance system without friction allows greater control of tooth movement during space closure. specialized precalibrated springs for space closure are an integral part of the segmented arch technique. precalibrated attraction springs have three characteristics of interest: 1) the alpha (anterior) moment produced by the spring; 2) the beta (posterior) moment produced by the spring; and 3) the horizontal force generated. the type of movement is dictated by the moment to force ratio (m/f) generated by the appliance at the attachments. typically, m/f ratios of approximately 7:1 millimeters result in controlled tipping, 10:1 millimeters result in translational movements, and values of 12:1 millimeters or greater accomplish root movement. these ratios are based on the assumptions that the root lengths are 12 millimeters, the distance from the bracket slot to the alveolar crest is five millimeters, the alveolar bone condition is normal, the axial inclination of the teeth is normal, and the center of resistance is located apically a distance .40 times the root length when measured from the alveolar crest to the apex. the variation of the center of resistance with differing levels of bony support is shown in figure 1. with a change in the center of resistance the m/f ratio must be modified (figure 2); thus, in adult patients with periodontal loss, higher m/f values must be attained.","{'answer_start': [803], 'text': ['7:1 millimeters']}",,biomechanics,"{'authors': ['Clemens Manhartsberger, DDS, MD', 'John Y.

"according to kusy, what are the factors affecting the frictional forces between brackets and archwires?","orthodontic tooth movement is not continuous and linear but discontinuous and dynamic. several factors affecting the frictional resistance in orthodontic treatment should be considered. kusy suggested that factors affecting the frictional forces between bracket and archwire were material, surface roughness, hardness, wire stiffness, geometry, fluid media, and surface chemistry. similarly, vaughan et al listed several variables (archwire, ligation of archwire to bracket, bracket, orthodontic appliance, and intraoral variables) that can contribute to the frictional force level. various reports have described methods that measure the frictional forces between the archwire and bracket and archwires and classified them into three large groups that will be discussed later. the three established methods can hardly measure the gradual changes of the frictional force levels in clinically relevant angulation-changing condition. the pin on disk type friction tester (figure 1) is a device that has been used to measure the frictional force and the degree of wear between two materials. this device can measure movements such as a circular or reciprocal at any given angle with various angular speeds. the motion pattern of the friction tester is suitable for simulating orthodontic tooth movement of gradual angular changes (figure 2). so far, few attempts have been made to study the frictional resistance of lingual bracket. lingual brackets are similar to labial brackets but have some differences in dimensions and clinical aspects. almost all lingual brackets are single brackets and have narrower m-d width than labial brackets because of the anatomical limitation and intention to obtain adequate interbracket distance. therefore, they are susceptible to tipping under traction force. the purposes of this study were to determine the possibility of a new measuring method with a pin on disk type friction tester for the measurement of the frictional forces between lingual brackets and archwires under varied conditions, and to measure the difference in frictional force depending on the type of brackets and material and size of archwires under the conditions where the angulation between the bracket and archwire changed continuously.","{'answer_start': [280], 'text': ['material, surface roughness, hardness, wire stiffness, geometry, fluid media, and surface chemistry']}",,materials,"{'authors': ['Ji-Hoon Park, DDS, MDS', 'Yong-Keun Lee, DDS, PhD', 'Bum-Soon Lim, MS, PhD', 'Cheol-We Kim, DDS, PhD'], 'doi': 'https://doi.org/10.1043/0003-3219(2004)074<0816:FFBLBA>2.0.CO;2', 'meta': 'Angle Orthod (2004) 74 (6): 816–824.', 'title': 'Frictional Forces Between Lingual Brackets and Archwires Measured by a Friction Tester'}",ce00d265-d2b3-4361-917a-1fbb337b1f43
"what are two limitations of removable appliances compared to fixed? [dependent on pt compliance] regarding early orthodontic treatment with removable appliances, what will affect treatment success?","early orthodontic treatment with removable appliances is intended to prevent dentofacial unbalance in the mixed dentition and to reduce the overall need for later complex orthodontic treatment with fixed appliances. interceptive treatment is based on the principle that correction should be performed before an abnormality has fully developed. this idea was supported by king et al. when they focused on the perception of early treatment benefits. the use of a planas functional device, based on the overall rehabilitation of the stomatognathic system using neuro-occlusal rehabilitation, constitutes an effective way to correct early abnormality, including maxillary and mandibular overcrowding in the mixed dentition. the success of early orthodontic treatment with removable appliances is highly dependent on patient compliance, defined as the extent to which the patient's behavior matches the practitioner's recommendations. witt et al. described some factors that determined the patient's compliance, such as regimen, perceived comfort, patient personality, and parental attitudes, but many other influencing factors have been reported in the literature. several methods exist to assess compliance, but most are subjective and tend to overestimate wear time (wt). today, wt can be reliably measured by temperature-sensitive microsensors incorporated in the removable appliance by polymerization; the theramon sensor (theramon system; gschladt, hargelsberg, austria) is widely used for its reliability and ergonomics. the aim of the present study was to assess patient compliance in preventive expansion treatment with removable planas functional appliances. the primary objective was to estimate wt with theramon microsensors. the secondary objective was to establish how wt impacted treatment efficacy.","{'answer_start': [812], 'text': ['patient compliance']}",,clinical,"{'authors': ['Carole Charavet', 'Michel Le Gall', 'Adelin Albert', 'Annick Bruwier', 'Sophie Leroy'], 'doi': 'https://doi.org/10.2319/122917-888.1', 'meta': 'Angle Orthod (2019) 89 (1): 117–122.', 'title': 'Patient compliance and orthodontic treatment efficacy of Planas functional appliances with TheraMon microsensors'}",05282770-86df-4606-8748-57893a99e39b
"regarding indirect bonding of lingual brackets, what is the effect of sandblasting enamel prior to acid etching on orthodontic bracket bond strength compared to acid etching only?","objective: to compare bond strength and bond failure location of lingual brackets indirectly bonded after lingual enamel sandblasting with 27-, 50-, and 90- m aluminum oxide particles followed by 37% phosphoric acid etching. material and methods: eighty maxillary premolars were randomly divided into four equal groups according to the method of lingual enamel surface conditioning: group 1 (control) was etched with 37% phosphoric acid, and group 2, group 3, and group 4 were sandblasted with 27-, 50-, and 90- m aluminum oxide particles, respectively, prior to acid etching. lingual brackets were indirectly bonded using the same protocol and adhesive (sondhi) in all groups. the maximum shear bond strength required to debond the brackets was measured using a testing machine, and the bond failure location was classified according to the adhesive remnant index (ari). analysis of variance was used to compare the mean bond strength between groups. the differences between ari scores were evaluated using the kruskal-wallis test. results: there were no statistically significant differences in mean shear bond strength or ari scores between the four enamel-conditioning procedures. conclusion: lingual enamel sandblasting using different particle sizes of aluminum oxide prior to phosphoric acid etching did not increase the shear bond strength of indirectly bonded brackets and did not affect the amount of adhesive remnant on the enamel. in an effort to produce a more accurate and efficient bracket positioning system, silverman et al. developed the indirect bracket bonding technique. at first, the technique was deficient, and many orthodontists abandoned the idea. however, in time, the indirect bonding has improved in technique, materials, and in vitro bond strength. clinical failure rates are currently comparable with those found for directly bonded brackets. improvements of the indirect bonding technique have been particularly important for lingual orthodontics. the great anatomic variation of the lingual surfaces, the difficulty in access, the lack of direct visualization, and the need to customize the bracket bases to ensure adequate height, angulation, in/out, and torque often force orthodontists to bond lingual brackets using indirect bonding techniques.","{'answer_start': [1197], 'text': ['lingual enamel sandblasting using different particle sizes of aluminum oxide prior to phosphoric acid etching did not increase the shear bond strength of indirectly bonded brackets']}",,materials,"{'authors': ['Julissa Janet Robles-Ruíz', 'Ana Lidia Ciamponi', 'Igor Studart Medeiros', 'Lylian Kazumi Kanashiro'], 'doi': 'https://doi.org/10.2319/120613-897.1', 'meta': 'Angle Orthod (2014) 84 (6): 1068–1073.', 'title': 'Effect of lingual enamel sandblasting with aluminum oxide of different particle sizes in combination with phosphoric acid etching on indirect bonding of lingual brackets'}",cf65c364-dfa9-4e54-bf9e-eb1755b0bb3a
"after molar distalizatino with a pedulum appliance, why is a nance button used during fixed orthodontics?","several investigations evaluated the efficacy of the pendulum appliance, reporting data relative to soft-tissue and dentoskeletal changes that occurred from the beginning (t1) to the end of the distalization phase (t2). however, only few studies showed findings at the end of fixed appliance therapy (t3), and data relative to long-term dentoskeletal effects (t4) are lacking. angelieri et al. stated that the results of his study should not be applied after the stage of craniofacial growth and development as further long-term investigations are needed. therefore, our study aimed to investigate dento-skeletal effects of the pendulum appliance during a 7-year postretention follow-up. in particular, long-term observation focused on two main topics: residual molar distalization rate and stability of the class i molar relationship. it has been widely demonstrated that maxillary molars show a distal movement during the distalization phase (t1 t2), which partially or completely relapses at the end of orthodontic fixed appliance therapy (t2 t3); burkhardt et al. reported that after comprehensive treatment, the maxillary first molar was only 0.8 mm distal to its original position, and similar results were observed by chiu et al. this forward movement can be considered a normal process of dentoalveolar compensation during mandibular growth in order to maintain class i molar relationship. our study focused on changes that occurred between t2 t4 and t3 t4 in order to discern whether major modifications occurred during orthodontic treatment and whether minor modifications may also be observed in the postretention period during the completion of individual growth. the maxillary first molar showed distal movement and distal crown tipping during the distalization phase (t2) but mesial movement and mesial crown tipping during orthodontic fixed appliance therapy (t3) and the postretention period (t4). however, only 0.2 mm of mesial movement and 0.4 of mesial tipping were detected after completion of orthodontic treatment, suggesting that 91% of the relapse occurred during fixed appliance therapy, whereas no significant change was detected in the postretention period. moreover, considering that 5.1 mm molar distal movement was observed during the distalization phase and only 2.2 mm of relapse between t2 t4, it can be stated that 57% of the distalizing effect was maintained during maxillary growth. these data disagreed with those of chiu et al. and burkhardt et al., who reported that about 90% and 87% of the molar distalization achieved by the pendulum appliance during the first phase of treatment was lost during fixed orthodontic treatment. therefore, use of anchorage reinforcement such as the nance button or intermaxillary elastics is critical for retention of the distalized maxillary molars during retraction of the anterior teeth. despite that, a marked tendency of the molars to return to the initial sagittal position was also detected by melsen and dalstra; however, the mean age of their sample ranged from 8.0 to 10.4 years old, and retention protocols may not be effective at an early age. moreover, the use of extraoral traction can be more indicated to restrain maxillary growth than to distalize maxillary molars, and orthopedic effects generated at an early age with functional or extraoral appliances are highly reversible.","{'answer_start': [2777], 'text': ['retention of the distalized maxillary molars during retraction of the anterior teeth']}",,clinical,"{'authors': ['Alberto Caprioglio', 'Mattia Fontana', 'Elena Longoni', 'Mauro Cozzani'], 'doi': 'https://doi.org/10.2319/050812-378.1', 'meta': 'Angle Orthod (2013) 83 (3): 447–454.', 'title': 'Long-term evaluation of the molar movements following Pendulum and fixed appliances'}",8f164fe1-ef87-4f55-b579-8aecc18a5ec3
"in patients who received rapid maxillary expansion (rme), what is reported by patients regarding nasal airflow?","of interest is a patient-reported improvement in airflow through the nose after rme therapy. with normal anatomy, inspired air passes at high velocities anteriorly up to the nasal valve area, after which velocity drops substantially because of increased volume in the nasal cavity. airflow deviates from laminar to turbulent once inside the nasal cavity, thereby promoting the resultant cleaning and conditioning of inspired air. air through the nose has been thought of as passing through a series of pipes of varying cross-sections, but nasal anatomy is complex, resulting in limitations of this postulation. although a physically compressible medium, air is said to be incompressible at velocities below 0.3 mach a condition that is largely satisfied by the current situation. air traveling through the nasal passage can be accurately modeled by bernoulli's equation, with consideration of flow across the nasal valve region as a result of pressure differences, with constant density and negligible viscosity. bernoulli's principle, which was developed from the momentum equations with assumptions of conservation, states that for a fluid, an increase in speed of the fluid occurs simultaneously with a decrease in pressure. flow in the nose is analogous to a subsonic diffuser; therefore, from the continuity equation, the volumetric flow rate must be maintained, which leads to slower air velocity. the nasal valve was defined by cole as a short resistor of a few millimeters in length with a base at the floor of the nose, the lateral walls as the ala, and a bony caval entrance anterior to the inferior turbinate and within a few millimeters of the bony pyriform aperture. because the nasal valve is contributed to in part by the lateral walls of the nasal cavity, widening of these walls by rme may result in an increase in the nasal valve (increasing mca), thereby decreasing resistance to nasal airflow. in laminar flow, ohm's law states that resistance equals the change in pressure divided by volumetric flow rate (r = thetap/q), and in conditions of turbulent flow, the formula changes to the square of the volumetric flow rate (r = thetap/q2). when theory is applied to clinical findings, it can be seen that as a result of rme, both nasal volume and mca increase, thereby decreasing resistance to airflow and allowing increased movement of air through the nasal passage with decreased nasal respiratory effort.","{'answer_start': [34], 'text': ['improvement in airflow through the nose']}",,clinical,"{'authors': ['Jillian M.

"in a shape memory alloy, what is the martensite formed by stress?","in a shape memory alloy, transformation from an austenite to a martensite phase can also occur by application of stress within a defined temperature range. the martensite so-formed is called stress-induced martensite (sim), and the driving force for the transformation is mechanical, as opposed to within a temperature range, martensite can be made stable with the application of stress, but it becomes unstable again when the stress is removed. there is a linear relationship between stress and temperature with respect to induction of martensite; a decrease in temperature is equivalent to an increase in stress. the terms pseudo-elasticity and superelasticity have often been used interchangeably. the former is a more general term, denoting any nonlinearity in the stress-strain curve during pseudo-elasticity can be caused by either twinning, i.e., reversible motion of twin boundaries in the structure, or by transformation, i.e., a stress-induced martensitic transformation from an austenitic phase. transformational pseudo-elasticity is called superelasticity in its fully evolved form, and manifests itself by a flat or nearly flat plateau in the stress-strain curve during which the transformation takes place. at the plateau, a superelastic alloy does not follow hookes law, since there is little change in stress with increasing strain. thus, superelastic archwires may exert the same amount of force independent of the degree of activation within a wide range. since low and continuous forces are believed to be most efficient for tooth movements, such archwires have been proposed as nearly ideal for orthodontic treatment.","{'answer_start': [191], 'text': ['stress-induced martensite']}",,materials,"{'authors': ['Torstein R.

"regarding fibro-osseous dysplasia, when is the lesion usually discovered?","a fibro-osseous dysplasia is a slowly growing benign tumor. it is usually noticed by adolescence and the size draws attention to the area as no pain is experienced. the maxilla is involved slightly more often than the mandible. it is more common in females than males. where the maxilla is involved, deformity of the orbit and ocular proptosis sometimes occur. palpation reveals a smooth, hard bone with no tenderness. found mostly in the premolar-molar region, the antrum may be encroached upon and obliterated. it appears radiopaque on x-rays indicating that it is more osseous than fibrous. the lesion is benign. radical surgical resections are contra-indicated. only that surgery which is desirable for cosmetic purposes should be considered. other terms used to describe this mass are central osteoma, exostosis, localized fibrous osteodystrophy, localized osteitis fibrosa, hypertrophic localized osteitis, and localized leontiosis ossea. the etiological cause is based in some deeply rooted developmental defect, though it does not show any familial or hereditary factor. it is seen early and grows slowly during the general growth period, and then becomes static after general growth has ceased. ossifying fibrous and fibrous dysplasia of bone should be considered as variants of one neoplastic process. it is the nature of this neoplasm to be quite cellular; there are no records of its undergoing sarcomatous changes. the bones in the remaining part of the skeleton usually are not affected.","{'answer_start': [60], 'text': ['it is usually noticed by adolescence and the size draws attention to the area as no pain is experienced']}",,pathology,"{'authors': ['Robert F.

"regarding intra-oral pressures, what is the effect of a low tongue position on molar crossbite?","it will be noted that whilst the subject was sucking the thumb the pressure never rose above atmospheric pressure and that the sucking activity produced a corresponding fluctuation of the trace at an average rate of twelve to fourteen pulses per ten seconds. in some other subjects who were digital suckers is was noted that the rhythmic sucking activity did not always cease when the digit was removed from the mouth but continued intermittently with much the same intensity. in one observed case this rhythmic sucking activity has persisted for three months after the cessation of thumb sucking. with much the same intensity. this paper is intended only to demonstrate a method of measuring accurately the intraoral pressure variations. the air pressure tracings shown are from only three subjects out of a great many who have been examined and it is not possible from these three alone to draw any firm conclusions. frankel has suggested that negative air pressure variations could affect the shape of the developing arches. little is known about such effects or about the effect of negative air pressure on features such as buccal crosbites. the use of this apparatus also throws some light on the position and activity of the tongue. thus, if there is a constant negative pressure in the palatal vault the oral cavity is sealed by the tongue both anteriorly and posteriorly. if this same negative pressure is recorded in the buccal vestibule also, this indicates a low tongue position and the two features of low tongue position and negative air pressure in the buccal vestibule may predispose to molar crossbite. further research along these lines is obviously necessary, no mention has yet been made of that primary area of suction, the lips and incisor region. the angulation of the incisor teeth may be affected as much by sucking activity with the lips closed as by the pressure exerted by the lips themselves. the simultaneous use of two or more pressure transducers on either side of the teeth will help to solve a number of these problems. the apparatus can also be adapted to measure the actual pressure of the tongue, lip or cheek on the teeth by replacing the open end of the tube with a small balloon and filling the whole system with water. however, if it is desired to make measurements of the pressure exerted by the soft tissues on the teeth, it will first be necessary to find out to what extent any negative air pressure in the mouth is causing lips or cheeks to be pressed on to the teeth by the pressure of the atmosphere. the apparatus described here was designed primarily with this objective in mind.","{'answer_start': [1468], 'text': ['a low tongue position and the two features of low tongue position and negative air pressure in the buccal vestibule may predispose to molar crossbite']}",,pathology,"{'authors': ['A.

"in growing class iii patients, how does the chin cap headgear alter growth direction of the mandible?","this conclusion was reached by examining the correlation of timing of growth in standing height with ossification events in hand bones and with each mandibular measurement. however, correlation of growth timing between the mandible and standing height and/or hand bones is still controversial (nanda 1955, bhamba 1961, hunter 1966, fukuhara and matsumoto 1968, bergersen 1972). this is a critical point in the assessment of the timing of facial growth in relation to the effect of chin cap force to a growing mandible. growth direction seemed to be altered downward or downward and backward by the chin cap force, as reported by previous studies. this was indicated by the specific change of the growth direction at the chin that occurred when a chin cap was used. alteration of the direction was limited to the period that the force was applied. inherited growth direction seems to be maintained, and to recover when the mechanical intervention is removed. the change of growth direction at the chin should be somewhat related to the length of daily chin cap wearing time (jo et al. 1980). it has been indicated that wearing a chin cap for more than 9 hours and less than 15 hours per day could produce various effects on the direction of chin displacement. thus, growth direction and growth velocity seem to react differently to the time length of the force application.","{'answer_start': [557], 'text': ['downward or downward and backward']}",,clinical,"{'authors': ['Hideo Mitani', 'Toshihiko Sakamoto'], 'doi': 'https://doi.org/10.1043/0003-3219(1984)054<0093:CCFTAG>2.0.CO;2', 'meta': 'Angle Orthod (1984) 54 (2): 93–122.', 'title': 'Chin Cap Force to a Growing Mandible: Long-term clinical reports'}",e984d28b-2ac1-41ae-9d20-a06116a39512
"regarding the esthetics of smiles, what is a low smile line?","one of the most important aspects of dental and facial esthetics is the vertical anterior tooth display. esthetic judgment is made by viewing the patient from the front in dynamic states like conversation, facial expressions, and smiling. tjan and miller in a study of the full smiles of 454 students, aged 20 30 years, divided the smile line into three types: a high smile line, revealing the complete maxillary incisors and a continuous band of the gingiva; an average smile, revealing 75 100% of the maxillary incisors; and a low smile, revealing less than 75% of the maxillary incisors. the high smile line, defined as gingival smile line (gsl) or gummy smile (gs), commonly provokes strong concern from clinicians. orthodontists and surgeons are conditioned to see a gs as esthetically undesirable. treatment alternatives of gs include various combinations of orthodontics periodontal and surgical therapy, depending on the diagnosis of the gs. because the effective correction of excessive gingival display is not a conservative orthodontic treatment, but a combined interdisciplinary treatment,5 7 or sometimes an invasive surgical procedure, the most important factor to be considered is whether the gs should be treated or not. as peck and peck claimed we orthodontists tend to forget that facial esthetics is a subject that interests all people everywhere, and the ultimate source of esthetic values should be the people and not just ourselves. the gs is not necessarily unesthetic in the eyes of the public. many actors, models, and beauty contestants, especially women, expose gingival tissue at smile and are still considered beautiful people with beautiful smiles. kokich et al used female smiles and found that lay people were unable to detect an incisal plane tilting until it was three mm, and gingival exposure was classified as noticeable unattractive only at four mm. the dilemma whether to treat the gs or not is further emphasized by the effect of aging on gingival display. the lip coverage of the maxillary incisors tends to increase with age, and high smiles will normally diminish with age. therefore, the gsl may be considered a youthful characteristic. the increased lip coverage of the upper incisors with age improves the smile esthetics of individuals with gsl while deteriorating the oral esthetics of intermediate or low smile lines creating less exposure of the incisors and an older appearance. the effect of aging on the lower gingival display is the opposite, with the lower gingival display increasing with age. another aspect of the dilemma of treating gsl is the probable sex difference. according to van der geld and van waas's literature search, it appears that the smile line was, on average, situated higher among women than among men. a social aspect of the gsl subject that has not been studied yet is a possible difference between men and women in the perception of oral esthetics of each of the two sexes.","{'answer_start': [540], 'text': ['revealing less than 75% of the maxillary incisors']}",,clinical,"{'authors': ['Silvia Geron', 'Wasserstein Atalia'], 'doi': 'https://doi.org/10.1043/0003-3219(2005)75[778:IOSOTP]2.0.CO;2', 'meta': 'Angle Orthod (2005) 75 (5): 778–784.', 'title': 'Influence of Sex on the Perception of Oral and Smile Esthetics with Different Gingival Display and Incisal Plane Inclination'}",8dd1fa85-622d-4aaf-a5a4-1de8bd0220e0
"regarding the leeway space, what is the size differential between maxillary deciduous molars and the premolars?","in the circumpubertal growth period, spurting and differential mandibular and maxillary growth become characteristic. downs recognized this in his classical cephaloradiographic studies and it is in sicher s work that we see the explanation. he showed that, while the mandible and maxilla both grow by apposition of bone tissue, they each have, in addition, an individual bone growing method, viz., sutural growth in the maxilla and appositional cartilaginous growth in the mandible. it is the two different mechanisms of growth, sutural growth in the maxilla and appositional cartilaginous growth in the mandibular condyles, that give rise to the differential mandibular and maxillary growth so characteristic of the circumpubertal period. in normal facial growth the mandible grows at a more rapid rate than the maxilla. during the period of the deciduous dentition the mandibular teeth, carried by the body of the mandible, are progressively moving anteriorly in relation to the maxillary teeth with a reduction of horizontal and vertical overbite. for this to occur without trauma, occlusal attrition of the deciduous teeth is essential. after the permanent incisors have erupted, overjet or horizontal overbite is present in the dentition of the normal eight, nine or ten year-old child but this is very often overlooked in treatment. normally the overjet is reduced with the more rapid mandibular growth without trauma to the incisor teeth. it is because of this mandibular growth rate that the leeway space exists in the buccal segments. the maxillary deciduous molars are 1.5 mm wider than the premolars, and in the mandible the difference is 2.5 mm. this allows a latitude of mesiodistal adjustment for the erupting premolars and for the mesial inclination and drift of the permanent first molars to attain the intercuspation of satisfactory anatomical occlusion. in the natural, normal development of dental occlusion there is a high degree of correlation with the growth of the face. this is not a measurable ratio but it must exist. as growth and development are concluded, the occlusal relations of the teeth should be such that the normal function of the two temporomandibular joints is possible. with the introduction of orthodontic therapy an acceptable occlusal relation of the teeth may be achieved, but the timing with growth may be lost so that the occlusion is not coordinated with mandibular growth. at first, abnormal function may not be present as the occlusion, established orthodontically at perhaps the age of eleven years, may permit normal function. as mandibular growth continues, the disharmony develops and the same occlusal relationship of the teeth no longer permits the condyles to be in their normally balanced relations to the articular eminences when the teeth are occluded. clicking and crepitus of the temporomandibular joints is quite prevalent in our teenage retention and postretention patients. relapse or failure in treatment should encompass more than the recurrence of tooth irregularity and unsatisfactory facial contour and should include excessive functional forces on the teeth that are conducive to pathology of the vital structures, abnormal function of the temporomandibular joints, and abnormal function of the musculature.","{'answer_start': [1544], 'text': ['the maxillary deciduous molars are 1.5 mm wider than the premolars']}",,growth,"{'authors': ['JOHN R.

"in the european population, what are the most common teeth missing in the permanent dentition excluding third molars?","the aim of this study was to assess a possible association between hypodontia and eoc in the slovenian population. prevalence of tooth agenesis has been addressed by numerous studies. in most populations, the reported hypodontia prevalence, excluding third molars, varies from 2.6% to 10.1%. in white populations the prevalence of hypodontia (excluding third molars) is generally in the range of 5% to 8%.3 hypodontia prevalence (excluding third molars) in the slovenian population is 6.9% (7.8% in women and 5.9% in men). researchers from the university of kentucky, lexington, found 3% prevalence of hypodontia and microdontia in a control group, and 20% prevalence of hypodontia and microdontia in patients with eoc. in our study, only patients with hypodontia were included, giving 19.2% hypodontia prevalence in women with eoc, while the prevalence of the control group was very similar to the general population of slovenia. studies on european populations mostly reported a higher prevalence of the missing mandibular second premolar, followed by upper lateral incisors and upper second premolars. agenesis of second premolars and upper lateral incisors accounts for 85% of all affected teeth among white populations. in the slovenian population, the most common missing teeth are mandibular second premolars, followed by maxillary lateral incisors. chalothorn et al. reported that maxillary lateral incisors were the most frequent missing teeth in patients with eoc. in our study, we found that the teeth missing most often in women with eoc were maxillary second premolars, followed by maxillary lateral incisors, mandibular second premolars, and mandibular central incisors. this result was quite different from the study of chalothorn et al. in the control group, we found the maxillary lateral incisors and mandibular second premolars were the most frequent missing teeth, similar to the reports of many authors who reported the prevalence of the hypodontia in the general white population. hypodontia of the maxillary second premolar rarely occurs in the general population, but it occurs most frequently in patients with eoc. at least one missing upper maxillary premolar was found in 52.2% of women with eoc and in only 12.8% of the control group. therefore, special attention should be recommended to women with this pattern of hypodontia. k cher et al. observed an increased frequency of family history of breast cancer and prostate cancer in individuals with at least one missing premolar as well as an increased frequency of all cancers in the group with at least one missing upper lateral incisor.","{'answer_start': [1288], 'text': ['mandibular second premolars']}",,pathology,"{'authors': ['Anita Fekonja', 'Andrej Čretnik', 'Iztok Takač'], 'doi': 'https://doi.org/10.2319/112813-876.1', 'meta': 'Angle Orthod (2014) 84 (5): 810–814.', 'title': 'Hypodontia prevalence and pattern in women with epithelial ovarian cancer'}",ffadaeff-4652-4e02-a049-78a7da55b27a
"in class ii patients, what is a disadvantage of headgear therapy?","management of class ii malocclusions is dictated by the severity of the problem and the age of the patient. a variety of treatment modalities are available, including extraction of maxillary premolars, headgear, class ii elastics, functional appliances, and orthognathic surgery. the use of headgear has been shown to be successful for correcting skeletal class ii discrepancies in growing patients by providing some orthopedic and mostly dental effects. however, despite the potential for achieving desirable treatment results, the success of this treatment modality depends heavily on patient cooperation. it has previously been shown that compliance with headgear use has a significant effect on treatment outcome and duration. in the orthodontic specialty, there was a rapid increase in the use of headgear through the mid-1980s followed by a decline in the routine use of this appliance from 1996 to present. interestingly, over the years the headgear treatment modality has been in and out of favor. especially over the past decade, clinicians appear to have abandoned headgear use because of increased difficulty in getting children to wear this appliance due to social or psychological concerns. whether to use headgear or alternative appliances, such as mara (mandibular anterior repositioning appliance), forsus, and herbst, which are more acceptable to today s children, is a practice management decision. indeed, patients acceptance of treatment with headgear has been reported to be only 41% as opposed to 88% with other class ii treatment modalities. another reason for the abandonment of the headgear could be the availability of new treatment options for correcting class ii malocclusions. with class ii functional appliances gaining popularity, there has been a decrease in the amount of headgear use. some examples of class ii fixed functional appliances include mara, forsus, and herbst, which can be used in conjunction with fixed appliances in class ii malocclusions without a need for patient cooperation. however, previous studies have shown that these noncompliance appliances are able to induce a combination of some skeletal but mostly dentoalveolar changes. in addition, geographic location has been shown to affect the rate of routine use of headgear. therefore, the decision to use headgear may depend on the local market because of the fear of losing patients to practitioners who use other class ii treatment modalities instead of headgear. to date, although a declining trend has been demonstrated in the literature, the reasoning behind orthodontists choice to select alternative modes of treatment has not been investigated. therefore, it would be of interest to know the factors behind the decrease in headgear use in modern orthodontics for class ii corrections. this study investigates orthodontists opinions and perceptions on the use of headgear in the treatment of class ii malocclusions.","{'answer_start': [529], 'text': ['the success of this treatment modality depends heavily on patient cooperation']}",,clinical,"{'authors': ['Eser Tüfekçi', 'Samuel B.

"with respect to bone remodelling, which type of bone is associated with secondary osteons?","bone remodeling is central to understanding growth and development and is the foundation of newer clinical procedures to accelerate orthodontic tooth movement. alveolar bone is a dynamic osseous tissue that undergoes both modeling and remodeling. bone modeling is an uncoupled process that results in a net change in the size or shape of osseous tissue. in contrast, bone remodeling is a coupled process of bone turnover of existing osseous tissue. bone growth involves both modeling and remodeling events, and these distinct processes are central to understanding bone physiology and adaptation. in addition, newer clinical procedures to accelerate orthodontic tooth movement such as periodontally accelerated osteogenic orthodontics and vibration have their biologic basis in altering the remodeling rate. the remodeling within the cortical compartment (intracortical) is described as secondary osteonal remodeling because the end result of remodeling process is the formation of new osteons with haversian systems in previously existing bone. these osteons are in contrast to the hemi-osteons that are typical of trabecular bone remodeling. primary osteons result from bone formation de novo, whereas the secondary osteons are associated with replacement bone.","{'answer_start': [1208], 'text': ['secondary osteons are associated with replacement bone']}",,biology,"{'authors': ['Letitia E.

"for patient with crowding treated with lip bumper, what was the effect of the treatment on lower incisor irregularity?","the analysis of the effects of lip bumper treatment in this study showed significant changes in arch width, arch length, arch depth, and incisor irregularity, table 1. although the absolute values differ among studies, the results from this study show treatment effects similar to others. generally, the greatest arch width gain occurs at the premolars and the least at the canines, with the molars somewhere between. arch length and arch depth increased significantly, whereas incisor irregularity decreased. the majority of the arch width increase was due to changes occurring during lip bumper treatment. with normal growth and relapse, the arch width decreased from t3 to t4 for all teeth. however, these decreases were only significant for the first and second premolars. the canines relapsed 19% (0.42 mm) of the treatment increase (2.20 mm). the first and second premolars relapsed, respectively, 26% (1.22 mm) and 34% (1.31 mm) of their treatment increases of 4.61 and 3.89 mm. the first molars relapsed 20% (0.56 mm) of the treatment increase (2.73 mm). despite this relapse, significant gains were maintained from t1 to t4 canines (1.78 mm), first premolars (3.39 mm), second premolars (2.58 mm), and first molars (2.17 mm). the decrease in irregularity shows that the lip bumper is an effective means for relieving anterior crowding. lip bumper treatment alone accounted for 41% (1.55 mm) of the total decrease in irregularity (3.73 mm). from t3 to t4, the irregularity relapsed 20% (0.76 mm) of this decrease, resulting in a significant t1-t4 decrease of 2.97 mm.","{'answer_start': [478], 'text': ['incisor irregularity decreased']}",,clinical,"{'authors': ['Michael Joseph Solomon', 'Jeryl D.

"regarding craniofacial growth, what is the posterior growth analysis ratio?","in figure 3 we have tried to illustrate the mechanism of the growth of the jaws. these five growth increments are the principal ones with which the orthodontist is concerned. the relationships of these increments control the behavior of the mandible. they determine whether pogonion shall move downward and forward or downward and backward and whether a class ii condition will be easy or difficult to correct. when pogonion and nasion grow forward at an equal rate, increment a will equal the sum of increments i, ii, iii and iv. in other words, growth at the condyles must equal the anteroposterior growth at nasion, plus the vertical growth of the corpus of the maxilla, plus the vertical growth of the maxillary alveolar process, plus the vertical growth of the mandibular alveolar process. then it may be said that the horizontal growth at the condyles is pitted against combined vertical growth. growth at the condyles is trying to carry the chin forward and combined vertical growth in the molar area is trying to carry the chin downward. the result is usually downward and forward; however, it may be downward and backward as we shall see. when growth at a exceeds i, ii, iii, and iv, the mandibular plane becomes flatter and pogonion moves forward more than nasion. when the sum of i, ii, and iv appreciably exceeds a, pogonion will usually move backward with relation to nasion and the mandibular plane will become steeper. when growth at a equals the sum of iii, and iv the mandibular plane moves down in a parallel manner. however, excessive mesial movement of the molar teeth causes difficulty in measuring vertical increments. the ratio between horizontal and vertical growth increments is called the posterior growth analysis. it is an aid in explaining the postural behavior of the mandible (fig. 2). please bear in mind that it is the relationship of these increments one to another which controls the forward growth and the rotation of the mandible.","{'answer_start': [1641], 'text': ['the ratio between horizontal and vertical growth increments']}",,growth,"{'authors': ['F.

"regarding craniofacial growth and the use of functional appliances (herbs, twin-block), what is a possible mechanism of growth modification at the condyle and glenoid fossa?","there is evidence that compensatory growth occurs at the temporomandibular joint, and especially the mandibular condyle, in response to altered occlusal function in young, growing animals. studies performed by mcnamara on monkeys and by petrovic et al on rats have shown that the condylar cartilage and bone in growing animals respond to the altered neuromuscular function induced by a protrusive appliance. these studies noted increased chondrocytic proliferation and subsequent bone deposition in a posterior and posterosuperior direction, so as to reposition the condyle within the mandibular fossa. quantitative histological studies have clarified the time-dependent nature of the adaptive response, indicating that the initial large changes in cartilaginous proliferation are progressively diminished when restoration of functional equilibrium is obtained. similar findings have been reported by kiliaridis et al. the condylar cartilage of the mandible is classified as a secondary cartilage, in contrast to primary long-bone epiphyseal articular cartilages. contrary to the epiphyseal articular cartilages, the condylar cartilage is not loaded by the weight of the body but by the repetitive and intermittent forces applied to the dentition during mastication. a number of in vitro and in vivo studies have shown that biomechanical stimuli are necessary for normal growth of the secondary cartilage. also, mechanical loading triggers specific biochemical responses in mandibular condylar chondrocytes (basdra et al, ziros and basdra). reducing the load on the mandibular condyle by reducing incisal contact has been shown to lead to a thinner cartilage layer than in controls. it has been hypothesized that the mechanism of condylar-fossa growth modification with propulsive mandibular appliances, such as the herbst and twin-block that use displacement of the mandible, involves viscoelastic tissue extension forces to the condyle through several different attachments and transduction of forces radiating beneath the fibrocartilage of the glenoid fossa and condyle, inciting significant osteogenic responses from both the fossa and the condyle.","{'answer_start': [1886], 'text': ['viscoelastic tissue extension forces to the condyle through several different attachments and transduction of forces radiating beneath the fibrocartilage of the glenoid fossa and condyle']}",,growth,"{'authors': ['Tarek El-Bialy, BDS, MS Ortho, MS OSCI, Ortho Cert, PhD', 'Iman El-Shamy, BDS, MS, PhD', 'Thomas M.

"regarding craniofacial growth, what causes clockwise rotation of the mandible?","what are these vertical elements of growth? specifically where are the increments which produce an increase in facial height? they are as follows: (fig. 3) (1) growth at nasion and in the corpus of the maxilla which produces an increase in the distance from nasion to anterior nasal spine and causes the maxillary molars and posterior nasal spine to move away from the sella-nasion plane, (2) growth of the maxillary posterior alveolar processes causing the molar teeth to move away from the palatal plane, and (3) growth at the mandibular posterior alveolar processes causing the molar teeth to move occlusally. the vertical growth of the anterior alveolar processes does not seem to have an appreciable effect on facial height. it is merely expressed in varying degrees of overbite. the dorsal migration of the glenoid fossa is a very real factor in many cases and tends to cancel out the growth of the condyles; thus, in a sense it is arrayed on the side of vertical growth. surface additions of bone at pogonion usually have an insignificant effect, but occasionally we do see quite appreciable apposition in this area. clockwise rotation of the mandible is a result of more posterior vertical growth than condylar growth, the point of rotation being the condyles. we know that when vertical growth exceeds horizontal growth, (condylar growth) pogonion cannot keep pace with the forward growth of the upper face and the mandibular plane must become steeper (fig. 2). what effect does this type of growth have upon treatment? obviously this condition would not help reduce the anb angle, and it would not aid in correction of a class ii molar relation. however, it would tend to help correct the vertical overbite of the incisors. many such growth patterns actually do reduce the vertical overbite, perhaps the majority do not. there is ample evidence to show that dominance of vertical growth of the face facilitates the correction and retention of vertical overbite. counterclockwise rotation of the mandible is a result of more condylar growth than combined vertical growth. this type of rotation is nearly always accompanied by a forward movement of pogonion and an increase in the this type of rotation is nearly always facial angle. the point of rotation is the most distal mandibular molar in occlusal contact. this flattening of the mandibular plane tends to increase the vertical overbite and renders vertical overbite correction and retention more difficult (fig. 1).","{'answer_start': [1174], 'text': ['more posterior vertical growth than condylar growth, the point of rotation being the condyles']}",,growth,"{'authors': ['F.

"regarding speech, how are the labial consonants /m/, /p/, and /b/ produced?","barlow and netsell and barlow and rath in studies of differential fine force control and maximal force of the upper and lower lips, concluded that the upper and lower lips should be viewed as separate structures in speech production. the lower lip with its greater mass must be faster than the upper lip and must travel twice the distance of the upper lip during the production of bilabial sounds. the labial consonants /m/, /p/, and /b/ are produced at the labial articulation zone by pressing the lips together. the consonants /p/ and /b/ are so-called stop consonants, because the air has to be retained by the lips until a certain pressure has been built up in the oral cavity and then suddenly released to produce these consonants. both consonants are voiceless and therefore not visible on a normal microphone recording, so to study them, they must be embedded between vowels in a sentence or in nonsense utterances. a higher intraoral pressure is needed for the production of /p/ than for /b/, although the electromyographic activity of the lips is the same for both tatham and morton assumed that for the production of /p/, at least the same amount of pressure 1s to hold the lips together as that being built up within the oral cavity. this was confirmed by lubker and parris and more recently by hinton and luschei, who found that the bilabial pressure was about double the intraoral pressure. the aim of the present study was to assess the extent to which the lips are pressed against the teeth during production of the consonant /p/, embedded in the (german) words papa and papagei of a given sentence, and to measure the pressure-time integral of the whole sentence and other variables in order to study the performance of the soft tissues acting on the teeth.","{'answer_start': [483], 'text': ['by pressing the lips together']}",,biology,"{'authors': ['Urs Thüer, DDS, Dr.med.dent.', 'Jürg Grunder, DDS, Dr.med.dent.', 'Bengt Ingervall, DDS, Odont.Dr.'], 'doi': 'https://doi.org/10.1043/0003-3219(1999)069<0133:PFTLOT>2.3.CO;2', 'meta': 'Angle Orthod (1999) 69 (2): 133–140.', 'title': 'Pressure from the lips on the teeth during speech'}",789527ae-b0f9-483c-ad88-21faabca039d
"regarding cone-beam computed tomography (cbct) imaging, which factors can affect the quality of the volume?","several standards have been used to assess the quality of cbct volumes: contrast-to-noise ratio (cnr) was considered the most commonly accepted method. the grayscale, quality, and contrast-to-noise ratio of any cbct image is determined by its settings, which includes fov, kvp, ma, voxel size, and other factors. fov selection has a direct effect on resolution and contrast of cbct volumes. zachary et al. found that smaller fov volumes were superior to larger fov in evaluating the temporomandibular joint erosive changes. hassan et al. noted similar results in detecting vertical root fractures with different sizes of fov. other studies found a relationship between fov and other settings but, because one size for fov was used, the effect of changing fov was out of the focus of this study. siegel et al. found similar results showing that changing the kvp affected the quality of the image. decreasing kvp resulted in poor quality volumes with more noise. when the kvp difference increased between two registered cbct volumes, more error in superimposition was observed (figure 5). after comparing all color-coded maps in figure 6, a direct relationship was found between noise, reducing ma, and the difference between registered cbct volumes. a 1 mm alteration in superimposition was found when high, moderate, and lowest settings were superimposed to the highest ma settings for 90 kvp mainly in the area of the teeth. because teeth are denser than bone, lowering ma settings had a greater impact on teeth compared to bone. a difference up to 0.704 0.143 mm was noted in the right gonial region when the 2 ma image was superimposed on the 10 ma image. nonetheless, image quality remained acceptable for a moderate or large ma setting reduction compared with the manufacturer recommended settings. some studies on cbct volumes taken by cs 9300 found that adequate cbct volume quality could be obtained by using low kvp and moderate to high ma, which reduced the amount of radiation exposure by about 30% compared with the manufacturer recommended settings.","{'answer_start': [268], 'text': ['fov, kvp, ma, voxel size, and other factors']}",,clinical,"{'authors': ['Manhal Eliliwi', 'Mohamed Bazina', 'Juan Martin Palomo'], 'doi': 'https://doi.org/10.2319/012719-52.1', 'meta': 'Angle Orthod (2020) 90 (2): 269–277.', 'title': 'kVp, mA, and voxel size effect on 3D voxel-based superimposition'}",e623f150-05aa-4f9d-8626-e213e5ea172e
"regarding root formation, when do premolars emerge?","for optimum results in serial extraction a deciduous tooth should be removed at a time when the permanent successor will emerge without delay. it has been shown in the present study that extraction of a deciduous molar at any age causes a brief spurt in premolar eruption, but the timing of clinical emergence is not necessarily affected. in fact, early extraction may result in delayed eruption and emergence. correctly planned extraction at a later period will result in accelerated emergence. the timing of extraction should be based on the developmental stage of the tooth and should coincide with its phase of active eruption. it has been shown by gron that premolars emerge when one-half to three-fourths of their roots are formed but canines have slightly more root formation at emergence. therefore, a deciduous tooth should not be removed until its permanent successor has an appropriate amount of root formation or at least one-fourth to one-half of the root length. it is also necessary to consider the ages at which the root stages mentioned are reached, as well as the duration, or interval, between these stages. from longitudinal data of dental development the mean age and standard deviation of attaining the one-fourth, one-half and three-fourth stages of root development in males and females for the canine, first premolar and second premolar are presented in table ii. the average duration of these stages is shown in table iii for the canine and premolars of males and females. this mean interval between the attainment of one-fourth and one-half root stages varies from 1.29 years in the second premolar to 2.32 years in the canine. the duration between the stages of one-half and three-fourths is less, varying from 1,05 to 1.59 years. it is emphasized that the time needed for root formation prior to emergence is longer than generally expected. however, the interval between the stages root three-fourths formed to root with open apex, associated with emergence of the teeth, is shorter, ranging from 0.51 years to 0.86 years.","{'answer_start': [680], 'text': ['when one-half to three-fourths of their roots are formed']}",,growth,"{'authors': ['Elizabeth A.

"regarding the biological mechanisms of pain, which peripheral receptors contribute to nociceptive behavior?","the possible role of periphery nmda receptors in orthodontic pain is further verified by local application of mk-801. the increased nocifensive behavior was attenuated by peripheral injection of mk-801 and the same with the nmdar1 expression. this finding suggests that mk-801 prevents activation of nociceptors such that their input does not reach the trigeminal ganglion. it has been previously demonstrated that activation of peripheral nmdars resulted in pain and mechanical allodynia or hyperalgesia, and that these nociceptive behaviors could be blocked by peripherally applied nmda receptor antagonists. despite the presence of other inflammatory mediators in the periodontal tissues, blockade of nmda receptors reverses the wiping behavior. this indicates that peripheral nmda receptors contribute to the nociceptive behavior induced by experimental tooth movement and suggests a possible functional interaction between nmda receptors and various inflammatory mediators.","{'answer_start': [769], 'text': ['peripheral nmda receptors contribute to the nociceptive behavior']}",,biology,"{'authors': ['Zhi Yang', 'Yan Wang', 'Wei Luo', 'Xiaochuan Hua', 'Peter Wamalwa', 'Jing Wang', 'Zhihe Zhao', 'Yun Lu', 'Zhengyu Liao', 'Wenli Lai'], 'doi': 'https://doi.org/10.2319/082308-444.1', 'meta': 'Angle Orthod (2009) 79 (5): 951–957.', 'title': 'Trigeminal Expression of N-Methyl-D-Aspartate Receptor Subunit 1 and Behavior Responses to Experimental Tooth Movement in Rats'}",7d978eac-be2d-47dc-9b5e-3af51acbfe1b
"regarding soft tissue limitations in orthodontics, which type of patient is at risk gingival recession if the mandibular incisor is moved facially?","current views about periodontic-orthodontic interrelationships have been summarized by vanarsdall and wennstrom. at a fundamental level, periodontal pathogenesis is strongly related to the bacterial flora and how an individual manages it (in terms of both hygiene and immune competence). because individual patients have varying susceptibility to loss of the attachment apparatus, it is important for the orthodontist to evaluate this when treatment is planned. for example, a patient with thin, friable tissue and little attached gingiva on the labial of a mandibular incisor is at risk for gingival recession if the tooth is moved facially out of its alveolar bone housing. if this labial tooth movement is accompanied by inflammation due to plaque retention there is even greater risk of recession. if the tissue is thin or if there is inadequate attached gingiva, there may be merit in prophylactically augmenting the tissue with mucogingival surgery and the placement of a split-thickness gingival graft. gingiva that has been augmented in this manner appears clinically to be more resistant to recession. tweed attempted to show with sectioned orthodontic casts that the labial plate of alveolar bone and gingiva in the mandibular incisor region becomes thinner if the incisors are moved labially, and this hypothesis was confirmed histologically in monkeys by wennstrom. no one has quantified how far labially mandibular incisors can be moved without significantly increasing the risk of recession, and obviously this would depend on the condition of the tissues initially. the anatomy of the alveolar bone and soft tissues in the area suggests that 2 to 3 mm would be the limit for most patients.","{'answer_start': [475], 'text': ['a patient with thin, friable tissue and little attached gingiva on the labial of a mandibular incisor']}",,clinical,"{'authors': ['James L.

"regarding orthodontic retention, how do vacuum-formed retainers compare to hawley retainers for the maintenance of incisor alignment?","it has been shown by a number of long-term studies that following a course of orthodontic treatment, relapse occurs in approximately 70% of cases. some of this will be due to orthodontic relapse, and some will be due to normal changes with time, such as continued facial growth. the problem for the orthodontist is that not only is it impossible to predict which cases will undergo relapse, but it is also impossible to predict the degree to which this will occur. relapse is unrelated to factors such as original incisor or molar classification, extractions, or the degree of tooth movement. not only is it difficult to predict which cases will require retention, but there is also currently no consensus on the amount or duration of retainer wear or indeed which type of retainer to use. patients can be provided with either fixed or removable appliances, and various studies have investigated the effectiveness of each. a recent investigation found multistrand bonded retainers to be more effective in maintaining tooth position than single-strand wires. a separate study investigating the effectiveness of bonded multistrand lingual retainers found them to be no more effective in retaining tooth position than a removable hawley-type retainer. in recent years, vacuum-formed retainers have become increasingly popular and for a number of reasons, but principally due to ease fabrication, improved esthetics, and reduced cost. purported disadvantages of vacuum-formed retainers include occlusal wear of the appliance with subsequent cracking in the longer term, along with reduced vertical settling. in terms of their effectiveness, a previous randomized controlled trial found vacuum-formed retainers to be as effective as hawley retainers in maintaining incisor alignment, although it has been suggested that they are not able to maintain arch expansion as well as a hawley. the aim of the current study was to compare the effectiveness of vacuum-formed and hawley retainers in maintaining arch width as well as incisor alignment.","{'answer_start': [1637], 'text': ['a previous randomized controlled trial found vacuum-formed retainers to be as effective as hawley retainers in maintaining incisor alignment']}",,clinical,"{'authors': ['Stephen Barlin', 'Roland Smith', 'Ray Reed', 'Jonathan Sandy', 'Anthony John Ireland'], 'doi': 'https://doi.org/10.2319/072610-437.1', 'meta': 'Angle Orthod (2011) 81 (3): 404–409.', 'title': 'A retrospective randomized double-blind comparison study of the effectiveness of Hawley vs vacuum-formed retainers'}",1d4c27df-6aa4-4c64-a6df-366a5fc10eef
"in orthodontics, what are the diagnostic records collected for treatment planning?","in developing a treatment plan for a patient, the majority of orthodontists obtain diagnostic records of diagnostic casts, intraoral photographs, extraoral photographs, and radiography that typically includes a panoramic radiograph and a lateral cephalometric radiograph. for the better half of a century, the lateral cephalometric radiograph has been a routine measure in orthodontic diagnosis and treatment planning. the primary purposes of the lateral cephalometric radiograph are to provide detailed views of the relationships between the patient's skeletal, dental, and soft tissue morphology, and to evaluate a patient's progressive response to treatment.2 debate exists regarding whether the lateral cephalometric image is necessary as part of orthodontic diagnosis and treatment planning, as the clinical exam has the potential to provide sufficient information for diagnosis. the degree to which the lateral cephalometric image is useful in treatment planning can often vary by case. employing cephalometric analyses also has been theorized to be a limited methodology that uses normative standardized values, which can be misleading due to the vast variation in craniofacial morphology of orthodontic patients. previous studies regarding the topic of whether lateral cephalometric radiographs are necessary for orthodontic treatment have resulted in varying and somewhat uncertain conclusions. in 1979, silling et al. conducted a study using 24 orthodontists and six cases that found that, for obvious cases, lateral cephalometric radiographs were not necessary but that they might be necessary for more complicated cases, like class ii, division i cases. stupar et al. also conducted a similar study using two orthodontists and 25 patient cases and found that the lateral cephalometric image had no influence on extraction treatment planning decisions. devereux et al. conducted a study in 2011 using 199 orthodontists and six patient cases and found that, for all patients but one, the lateral cephalometric image did not have a significant impact on treatment. most recently, durao et al. conducted a study in portugal using 10 orthodontists and 43 patients that found that the majority of the orthodontists felt that using the lateral cephalometric image was key for proper diagnosis but the results seemed to indicate the contrary. the uncertainty surrounding the issue indicated that further research on the utility of the lateral cephalometric radiograph would be beneficial. regardless, many orthodontists view the lateral cephalometric image as necessary for every patient case to track the progress resulting from treatment by overlaying cephalometric tracings taken prior to the start of treatment and cephalometric tracings taken during treatment. an estimated 90.5% of orthodontists in the united states routinely use the lateral cephalometric image as a pretreatment diagnostic record.","{'answer_start': [105], 'text': ['diagnostic casts, intraoral photographs, extraoral photographs, and radiography that typically includes a panoramic radiograph and a lateral cephalometric radiograph']}",,clinical,"{'authors': ['Anjali Dinesh a', 'Sunil Mutalik b', 'Jonathan Feldman c', 'Aditya Tadinada d'], 'doi': 'https://doi.org/10.2319/062319-425.1', 'meta': 'Angle Orthod (2020) 90 (5): 665–671.', 'title': 'Value-addition of lateral cephalometric radiographs in orthodontic diagnosis and treatment planning'}",53abaf8d-d2d3-4849-b42e-fa89bd15d9fb
which factors will influence the severity of anomalies caused by oral habits?,"related to the influence of muscles is that of habits, part of which is but a perverted muscle action. it seems rather superfluous to state that the lower together with the upper incisors are the teeth most of all exposed to displacement by habits. differences in the resulting anomalies are due to the varying combinations of duration, frequency and intensity, as has recently been emphasized by graber. it might, however, be added that these habits will superimpose their influence on the existing pattern only and will not change an originally existing tendency towards crowding or spacing. on the basis of the above theoretical considerations we shall now see what. conclusions we can draw for the practical application in diagnosis and treatment. newer diagnostic procedures following the lead of tweed are centered around the lower incisors. at the start came the postulate of an angle of 90 between the axis of the lower incisor and the mandibular plane. this was later complemented by the introduction of the frankfort mandibular plane angle; and finally the frankfort-lower incisor angle was arrived at. thus, all the angles of the frankfort-mandibular plane triangle have successively come into play and, if one is inclined to say so, one could state that this triangle has now run full circle. as the angles of a triangle add up to 180 and two angles were already fixed at 90 and at ca. 25, this new relationship does not mean anything essentially new, but simply follows as a mathematical consequence. the question now arises whether the angulation of these teeth is really as important as these continual diagnostic endeavors would have it appear. to a certain degree this question has already been answered. wylie (1955), testing cases treated by johnson and by tweed himself, found no correlation between the uprighting of the lower incisors and changes in the angle of convexity. the greatest change (16 ) actually occurred in a patient where the lower incisors were tipped even 1 forward while the greatest amount of tipping (24 ) produced a change of 9 only in the convexity angle. wylie therefore, comes to the conclusion that all these years orthodontists have been attaching exaggerated importance to the angulation of the lower incisors, so far as it is concerned in orthodontic diagnosis and treatment planning. essentially the 90 angle was a prosthetic principle en over into orthodontics, and its usefulness there has been doubted. wylie s investigation proved that these doubts were absolutely justified.","{'answer_start': [327], 'text': ['duration, frequency and intensity']}",,pathology,"{'authors': ['H.

"regarding the mechanical properties of pseudoelastic nitinol alloys, which phase has a higher stiffness?","in addition to this martensitic stabilized alloy, two other generic nitinol-type alloys are available today that are active, that is, they undergo some form of sme and are superelastic: an austenitic active alloy and a martensitic active alloy. in the austenitic active alloy, both the martensitic and austenitic phases play an important role during its mechanical deformation. martensite represents the low stiffness phase having an elastic modulus of 31 to 35 (to convert gpa to pa, multiply by 10; to convert pa to psi, divide by 6.9 x 10) and an ultimate strength of about 1.4 to 1.7 austenite represents the high stiffness phase having an elastic modulus of 84 to 98 and an ultimate strength of about 0.84 (to place these values in perspective, the elastic modulus [200 gpa] and ultimate strength [2.1 gpa] of stainless steel archwires should be compared.) thus on loading, the austenitic active alloy starts with a slope (stiffness) that produces some three times the force per activation of the conventional martensitic stabilized nitinol (figure 4). fortunately this effect is short-lived and gives way to a long plateau-like area. at first glance one would suspect that the mechanical properties are dismal; but perseverance prevails, as eventually a positive slope reoccurs wherein the stiffness is comparable to that of martensitic nitinol. in fact, a stress-induced phase has occurred in which the austenitic phase of this nitinol wire was transformed to the martensitic phase.","{'answer_start': [588], 'text': ['austenite represents the high stiffness phase']}",,materials,"{'authors': ['Robert P.

"regarding cephlometric analysis, what is the basion (ba) landmark?","basion has been suggested as a substitute for bolton point, but early headholders often had large metallic ear rod supports that obscured basion. radiographic film, technique and printing processes can also make clear definition of basion uncertain. indeed, it was claimed by in 1947 that basion cannot be identified in an x-ray film and the same is the case with the craniometric point porion. into this atmosphere bjork introduced articulare (ar), the intersection of the shadow of the undersurface of the basi-occiput with that of the posterior border of the neck of the mandible with the teeth being in centric relation (fig. 1). initially he defined the point with respect to the temporal rather than the occipital bone as is now accepted. relation of basion (ba) to articulare (ar). ba - the most anterior point on the margin of the foramen magnum. ar - the intersection of the image of the undersurface of the basi-occiput with those of the borders of the necks of the condyles, with the teeth being in centric relation. bjork was particularly interested in profile changes, so sella-nasion was unsuitable. he needed to use the full cranial base to minimize the effect of saddle angle change. as stated above, he could not identify basion. frankfort could not be used because of difficulty with porion. bolton, he argued, is often difficult to locate, but articulare on the other hand always shows up clearly. it may seem strange that such a fundamental reference point should be accepted seemingly on the sole recommendation that it always shows up clearly. nervertheless, articulare did seem to work in practice. with the passage of time articulare was seen to possess other virtues too. as the ability to locate basion improved, workers in the field began observing how the distance between basion and articulare in the same person did not seem to change.

"regarding the various alloys used for orthodontic wires, which alloy has the closest modulus of elasticity gold?","self-ligating or ligatureless brackets reappeared in the mid-1970s as strite, ltd, marketed them; these brackets had a stainless steel body and a positive-locking, spring-clip mechanism (figure 3b). their advantage was that unlike conventional ligation, friction is purportedly reduced but most importantly, friction becomes more reproducible. in 1977 the beta phase of titanium was stabilized at room temperature, and the aerospace titanium-molybdenum alloy ( -iii) was produced (figure 2d). this beta-titanium alloy has a modulus closest to that of traditional gold along with good springback, formability, and weldability. by the end of the 1970s, four major groups of wire materials came into existence, three of which developed different amounts of range for a given constant force (figure 6a), or if you kept the same range, they developed different magnitudes of force for a given constant deactivation (figure 6b). as a consequence, the armamentarium has expanded from just gold or stainless steel, and two slots have been popularized the 0.559 mm (0.022-inch) slot, which was originally used for gold, and the 0.457 mm (0.018-inch) slot, which was advocated for stainless steel. within the capabilities of the present armamentarium, both slots become viable alternatives. at this point, scientific investigators had to decide how to compare the plethora of materials. in the 1940s the strength and flexibility of wrought gold alloys were evaluated using tables that were based on measurements of the proportional limits and the wire diameters.116 even in thurow's day, variable cross-section orthodontics was the norm because stainless steel and cobalt-chromium wires essentially had the same stiffnesses (figure 7a). once the titanium alloys entered the scene, however, variable-modulus orthodontics became possible,118 and elastic property ratios could be derived in which both geometric and material characteristics were important. using equations, tables, or mathematically based figures called nomograms (figure 7b), the practitioner could now compare one wire with another in terms of its three elastic properties of clinical importance: stiffness, strength, and range.","{'answer_start': [498], 'text': ['beta-titanium alloy']}",,materials,"{'authors': ['Robert P.

"regarding cephalometric analysis, what is the mandibular plane angle?","the frankfort horizontal plane (p - o) is one used generally by the anthropologist to relate cranial and facial structures. it represents a plane that travels through the two porion points and the lowest point of the rim of the left orbit. the facial plane (n - po) is a frontal plane which travels through nasion and is tangent to the bony chin at pogonion. the angle made by this plane and the frankfort horizontal is taken as a measure of the relation of face to cranium, whether retrusive or protrusive. the angle of convexity (n - a - po) is constructed by connecting nasion and pogonion with a (the most recessive point below the anterior nasal spine). this angle is a measure of the degree of forward development of the maxillary base. m. p.

which teeth are most commonly impacted?,"impaction of permanent teeth is a common clinical occurrence that may involve any tooth in the dental arch. the teeth most often impacted, in order of frequency, are the maxillary and mandibular third molars, the maxillary canines and the mandibular second premolars. dachi and howell reported that 16.7% of 3,874 routine full mouth radiographs showed impacted teeth and that most were maxillary and mandibular third molars. mandibular second molar impactions were not reported. kramer and williams in their study of 3,745 full-mouth radiographs found impacted teeth in 18.2% of the cases, with third molars accounting for 95% of the impactions. no impacted mandibular second molars were mentioned. aitasalo and coworkers looked at 4,063 panoramic radiographs and found impacted teeth in 14.1%, with third molars accounting for 76.1% of the impactions. they did not report any second molar impactions. mead, in a study of incidence of impacted teeth found in 1,462 office cases, reported 89.7% third molar impactions and only 0.4% second molar impactions. grover and studying panoramic radiographs of 5,000 army recruits, reported that 98% of unerupted or impacted teeth were third molars and only 0.03% were mandibular second molars. while impacted third molars are a very common occurrence in dental practice, mandibular second molar impaction is a relatively rare dental anomaly. the real incidence of mandibular second molar impaction is unknown but is reported to be in the range of about 3 in 1000 when found, second molar impaction often presents a challenging problem to both the orthodontist and oral surgeon. unilateral impaction of the mandibular second molar is more common than bilateral impaction and occurs much more frequently in the mandible than in the maxilla. it has been found more often in males than in females and more frequently on the right side than on the left. impacted second molars are most commonly mesially inclined. the low frequency of mesially impacted second molars has kept the clinical significance of this anomaly quite low. consequently, little information is available in the dental literature. surgical repositioning is often recommended. however, orthodontic uprighting may be a better alternative, with a lower risk to the tooth. this paper discusses both surgical and orthodontic options and presents successful orthodontic treatment correcting bilaterally impacted mandibular second molars.","{'answer_start': [166], 'text': ['the maxillary and mandibular third molars, the maxillary canines and the mandibular second premolars']}",,pathology,"{'authors': ['Yehoshua Shapira, DMD', 'Gerald Borell, DDS', 'Oded Nahlieli, DMD', 'Mladen M.

"when using a cephalostat, how can we place the subject in natural head position?","the senior author of this paper has long advocated the use of natural head position in cephalometrics to avoid the potentially misleading information often resulting from conventional analyses. in conventional analyses, the prominence of the chin and the inclination of the mandibular plane are measured by and nasion-sella and the line tangent to the mandibular plane, respectively. the magnitude of these angles is not only determined by the prominence of the chin and the inclination of the mandibular plane, but also by the cant of the reference line sella-nasion, or frankfort horizontal. a downward inclination of the nasion-sella intracranial reference line decreases the size of the sella-nasion-pogonion angle, but increases the mandibular plane-sella-nasion angle. thus, the wrong conclusion is derived from cephalometric analysis, simply by variation in the cant of the reference line. that variation is inevitable because the landmarks of intracranial reference lines are subject to biological variation, as are the landmarks in the face and soft tissue profile. registration of the head in its natural position has the advantage that an extracranial vertical or horizontal, rather than an intracranial reference line, can be used for reference purposes. natural head position is not a new concept; it is used universally by plastic and maxillofacial surgeons, and by orthodontists for clinical examination of their patients. it is a standardized, reproducible position of the head in an upright posture and the eyes focused on a point in the distance at eye level. in cephalometrics, natural head position is achieved by instructing the subject, standing or sitting in the cephalostat, to look at a point on the wall exactly at eye level. natural head position can also be estimated, and these estimates are reproducible when observers are trained, experienced and possess a measure of common sense judgement. a keen eye can inspect radiographs taken by assistants, and if necessary, correct head posture for quality control. a final comment on this profile analysis concerns proportionate analysis with a rectilinear coordinate system or mesh diagram, based on natural head position, that reveals simultaneous graphic illustration of both sagittal and vertical components of individual variations in facial development, facial dysmorphology, or disharmonious development of the jaws for treatment planning and research. an array of indices or a myriad of angular measures and distances cannot readily match the immediate visual impact of the mesh diagram analysis. it offers many advantages for comprehensive, efficient and meaningful study of the facial configuration.","{'answer_start': [1634], 'text': ['instructing the subject, standing or sitting in the cephalostat, to look at a point on the wall exactly at eye level']}",,clinical,"{'authors': ['Anders Lundström, DDS, PhD, DSc, DDSc', 'Carl-Magnus Forsberg, DDS, PhD', 'Sheldon Peck, DDS, MScD', 'John McWilliam, DDS, PhD'], 'doi': 'https://doi.org/10.1043/0003-3219(1992)062<0127:APAOTS>2.0.CO;2', 'meta': 'Angle Orthod (1992) 62 (2): 127–133.', 'title': 'A proportional analysis of the soft tissue facial profile in young adults with normal occlusion'}",2bbf0c84-987b-4b94-9bbc-a696fe9ae1a3
"regarding the properties of materials, how is hysteresis measured?","above a certain force, the elasticity behavior becomes nonlinear. the upper plateau in figure 2 corresponds to the formation of sim plates preferentially oriented. on unloading, the reverse transformation occurs and the force-deflection curve follows the lower plateau region. it corresponds to the reverse transformation, and the martensitic phase is gradually transformed back to the austenitic phase. the difference in the magnitude of the forces on the upper plateau at 1.5 mm between archwire 0.016 /0.018 and 0.018/0.020 is about 40%. this difference is clearly less important in the unloading process (figure 3), where the difference is 15% than upon loading between the 0.016- and 0.018-inches cross section, but more important than for the 0.018 and 0.020 inches cross section about: 90%. however, the lower plateau region of the 0.020-inch curve is clearly inferior to the loading plateau of 0.016 inch. whatever the cross-sectional dimension, the stiffness of the material decreases when loading and unloading occurs, but the collapse is more important at the unloading process. the mechanical hysteresis, measured as the difference between the forces of the upper and the lower plateaus, increases with the cross-sectional dimensions (figure 4). moreover, the loading plateau remains constant, but it is associated with a change in the gradient of the sim, ie, the gradients become steeper with the sample size. this phenomenon is more evident on the diagram of the 0.020-inch sample. it is of interest to discuss the origin of the nonconventional profile of the loading and unloading curves and thus the origin of reversible deformation of these alloys. martensitic transformation and deformation have a close relation in various aspects.","{'answer_start': [1129], 'text': ['the difference between the forces of the upper and the lower plateaus']}",,materials,"{'authors': ['Pascal Garrec, DDS', 'Laurence Jordan, DDS'], 'doi': 'https://doi.org/10.1043/0003-3219(2004)074<0691:SIBOAS>2.0.CO;2', 'meta': 'Angle Orthod (2004) 74 (5): 691–696.', 'title': 'Stiffness in Bending of a Superelastic Ni-Ti Orthodontic Wire as a Function of Cross-Sectional Dimension'}",7fb882f1-f5c1-4fdd-abda-a6a988e9789b
"in patient who had an palatally impacted canine, what could explain lingual crown postition the previously impacted canine?","additional arch stabilization with a transpalatal arch or the use of a flexible wire overlying a heavy stabilizing rectangular arch wire may lessen the force on adjacent teeth and thereby minimize the risk of root resorption. in agreement with a previous study, a high frequency of posttreatment malalignment of the previously impacted canines was observed. this may reflect a tendency toward relapse. however, ideal root position may not have been achieved in all cases at the time of appliance removal. insufficient buccal root torque may explain the high frequency of lingual crown position at the time of follow-up. the high frequency of relative rotation and intrusion of the previously impacted canines may be explained by tensile pull from stretched supracrestal fibers. accordingly, correction of canine rotation early in treatment, followed by circumferential fiberotomy and use of a bonded retainer may be recommended. it should be emphasized, however, that none of the patients evaluated expressed any concerns and all were satisfied with the results of treatment.","{'answer_start': [505], 'text': ['insufficient buccal root torque']}",,clinical,"{'authors': ['Heather Woloshyn, DMD, MSD', 'Jon Årtun, DDS, Dr. Odont', 'David B.

what is the relationship between gender and change in incisor exposure?,"changes occur in the perioral region with aging. due to the proximity of the structures and joint action in facial dynamics, it is possible to assume that changes in the soft tissues may be reflected by changes in incisor and gingival exposure during speech and smile, leading to an aged appearance. our study analyzed the maxillary central incisor display in three different perspectives: rest, speech, and smile. with increasing age, we observed a significant decrease in the maxillary incisor display in all measures evaluated in both men and women, and this effect was more significant in men. vig and brundo reported a reduction in the maxillary central incisor exposure of approximately 3.4 mm as age increased from 30 years to 60 years. dickens et al. stated that the maxillary central incisor display at rest and smile decreased with age in men and women from the age of 20 years. desai et al. reported a significant reduction in the maxillary incisor display after 40 years of age, but that study included both men and women in the same groups. our investigation revealed that besides the effect of age, there is a gender dimorphism in maxillary central incisor exposure starting at the age of 25 years in all measurements evaluated, with men exhibiting less incisor display than women. in this study, the least, greatest, and maximum exposure of the maxillary central incisor were evaluated separately. morley and eubank reported that the pronunciation of the phoneme m assists in the biomechanics of orthodontic treatment, attributing older or younger features in appearance. these authors reported that younger patients exhibited an exposure of the maxillary central incisors of 2-4 mm, and that this was reduced with increasing age, even resulting in the disappearance of the maxillary incisor display. ackerman et al. verified differences in maxillary incisor exposure during smile and the pronunciation of the syllable chee. for these reasons, the authors sought to evaluate all of these variables and perform a complete study to better understand the vertical position of the maxillary central incisor through rest to smile during a video clip. the mandibular incisor display during speech increased with age in both men and women, but this was the only variable in the study that did not present a significant difference between genders in any of the age groups evaluated. thus, the greater display of the mandibular incisor with increasing age should be seen as a characteristic of aging common in men and women. sackstein, motta et al., and jacobson et al. also reported an increase in the mandibular incisor display with increasing age. the changes in maxillary and mandibular incisor display were not determined by changes in the positions of the teeth but, rather, by age-related modifications in the facial tissues, including the loss of lip elasticity and the effect of gravity on the lips.","{'answer_start': [1113], 'text': ['there is a gender dimorphism in maxillary central incisor exposure starting at the age of 25 years']}",,clinical,"{'authors': ['Stephanie Drummond', 'Jonas Capelli, Jr'], 'doi': 'https://doi.org/10.2319/042515-284.1', 'meta': 'Angle Orthod (2016) 86 (4): 631–637.', 'title': 'Incisor display during speech and smile: Age and gender correlations'}",aff24220-9148-47a9-b552-6aaafeac3b4f
"regarding the hand-wrist radiographic method of assessing growth, which observation coincides with the growth spurt of adolescence?","the accelerated growth in statural height found to coincide with the onset and progress of ossification of the adductor sesamoid bone is identified as the growth spurt of adolescence. the relative rates of growth recorded by the male and female subjects examined, the duration of the spurt, and the following deceleration to minimal increase or apparent cessation of growth in height are features consistent with what is known of this period of development. the cross-sectional findings suggest that adductor sesamoid ossification commences in females between eleven and twelve years of age and in males between thirteen and fourteen years. from the records of fifteen females and fifteen males longitudinally studied in this respect, the average age of onset is found to be 11 years, 7 months for the girls and 12 years, 11 months for the boys. the slightly earlier age of onset found longitudinally for the males (compared to the cross-sectional indication) is perhaps explained by the wide range of variability for age-at-appearance of this ossification centre. garn and rohmann observed that it may appear in girls between the eighth and thirteenth year or it may appear in the radiographs of boys between the tenth and sixteenth year. the median age was 10.5 years for the ninety-two girls and 12.6 years for the eighty-seven boys examined by garn and rohmann.","{'answer_start': [65], 'text': ['the onset and progress of ossification of the adductor sesamoid bone']}",,growth,"{'authors': ['S.

"regarding congenital defects, which gene is involved in the achondroplasia?","dwarfism occurs in about in in 1 in 26,000 individuals. achondroplasia is the most common form of dwarfism, and about 90% of cases are caused by new mutation. it is an autosomal dominant trait that affects males and females equally. recent biochemical investigations indicate that the congenital defect of fibroblast growth factor receptor fgfr is responsible for achondroplasia. it appears that recurrent mutations of a single amino acid in the transmembrane domain of the fgfr protein is the culprit. manifestations of achondroplasia include short stature and craniofacial malformations, including a short cranial base with early spheno-occipital closure and megalocephaly. failure of normal cartilage proliferation leads not only to characteristically short arms and legs, but also to underdevelopment of the midface because the upper jaw is not translated forward by normal lengthening of the cranial base. cephalometric characteristics of achondroplasia include an enlarged calvaria with hydrocephaly and frontal bossing, short posterior cranial base, retrognathic maxilla, normal mandible, and protrusive maxillary incisors. the patient in this report had maxillary skeletal retrognathia and severe maxillary dental protrusion. this case was treated orthodontically and has remained stable during a 2-year retention period. the patient, a 10-year-old japanese girl with achondroplasia, was 109 cm tall at the initial visit. she was diagnosed as achondroplastic at birth and had been receiving growth hormone treatment three times per day for 2 years at the department of pediatrics, tokushima university medical hospital. her chief complaint was maxillary protrusion. she had a history of tongue thrusting and lower lip biting. her dental history was unremarkable, and she appeared to be well adjusted, healthy, and intelligent. typical of achondroplasia, the patient exhibited a concave soft-tissue profile with a bulging forehead and a retrognathic maxilla. the nose was saddle-shaped because of lack of development of the nasomaxillary complex. there were no apparent major asymmetries, judging from both lateral and frontal photographs. the maxillary incisors were protrusive, causing the upper lip to protrude (figure 1a-c).","{'answer_start': [306], 'text': ['fibroblast growth factor receptor fgfr']}",,pathology,"{'authors': ['Tomoko Ohba, DDS', 'Yasuo Ohba, DDS, PhD', 'Satoru Tenshin, DDS, PhD', 'Teruko Takano-Yamamoto, DDS, PhD'], 'doi': 'https://doi.org/10.1043/0003-3219(1998)068<0377:OTOCID>2.3.CO;2', 'meta': 'Angle Orthod (1998) 68 (4): 377–382.', 'title': 'Orthodontic treatment of Class II Division 1 malocclusion in a patient with achondroplasia'}",8ba346c3-3b80-4a9a-a4a2-ae423f96c8e6
"in patients with skeletal open-bite, what is the recommended treatment for stability?","the surgical correction of skeletal open bite is difficult and its treatment outcome is less stable than surgical cases without skeletal open bite. the stability of skeletal open bite correction is dependent upon favorable neuromuscular adaptation to maintain the mandible in the new position. from this viewpoint, a bimaxillary osteotomy or a le fort i intrusion osteotomy with mandibular autorotation is recommended for correction of skeletal open bites. meanwhile, the correction of skeletal open bite by ssro alone is considered to induce considerable relapse due to the clockwise rotation of the mandibular body with lengthening of the suprahyoid muscles. however, oliveira and bloomquist reported on the stability of the bilateral ssro and rigid internal fixation in the closure of anterior open bite, and indicated that this surgical procedure was a relatively stable for the correction of anterior open bites. in the present case, the mandible was moved 4.0 mm backward with a counter clockwise rotation of 2.5 degrees at surgery. therefore, the lengthening of suprahyoid muscles after surgery was slight, so that the stability of the open bite correction obtained was present 1.5 years after the second operation. in addition, hoppenreijs et al suggested that the considerable relapse of transverse dimension was associated with recurrence of open bite after surgery irrespective of the surgical procedure. in the present case, we conducted a careful observation and rigid retention of the transverse dimension of the maxilla throughout treatment, which may produce good stability of open bite correction.","{'answer_start': [317], 'text': ['bimaxillary osteotomy or a le fort i intrusion osteotomy with mandibular autorotation']}",,clinical,"{'authors': ['Michiru Takeuchi, DDS', 'Eiji Tanaka, DDS, PhD', 'Daisuke Nonoyama, DDS', 'Junko Aoyama, DDS', 'Kazuo Tanne, DDS, PhD'], 'doi': 'https://doi.org/10.1043/0003-3219(2002)072<0362:AACOSO>2.0.CO;2', 'meta': 'Angle Orthod (2002) 72 (4): 362–370.', 'title': 'An Adult Case of Skeletal Open Bite with a Severely Narrowed Maxillary Dental Arch'}",56b9528b-6f06-4edc-a539-569f63b6f539
"regarding the choice of orthodontic wires, which factors should be considered for use in clinical practice?","unloading curves were nonlinear for many of the multistrand stainless steel and for all the nickel-titanium wires. it was not possible to define a single value of stiffness or slope of the bending plot for these wires. these results have supported the use of the polynomial regression method used in this investigation to determine the stiffnesses of these wire samples over a range of deflections. this methodology allows the evaluation of the instantaneous stiffness in standard mechanical tests and for orthodontic appliance systems. the results of this investigation have shown that wire stiffness can be altered not only by size but also by varying the number of strands and the alloy composition of the wire. this supports the concept of variable modulus orthodontics, which suggests changing stiffness by changing the elastic modulus rather than changing the wire size. the stiffnesses noted at different deflections for the multistrand stainless steel wires were variable in contrast to the constant stiffnesses recorded for the single-strand stainsteel wires. wire selections in clinical practice should include considerations of the alloy type, wire cross-section, and number of strands. all three factors are found to have a profound influence on wire stiffness.","{'answer_start': [1143], 'text': ['alloy type, wire cross-section, and number of strands']}",,materials,"{'authors': ['Jay M.

which type of hypersensitivity is related to nickel allergy?,"the release of nickel from alloys or devices is, among other things, related to the surface area, exposure time, and environment; but there seems to be no exact knowledge of the type and duration of oral exposure needed to elicit the induction of tolerance or reaction. the continuous exposure to nickel alloys might lead to oral tolerance mechanisms that modulate nickel sensitivity, as evidenced by the lower cell proliferation index in patients undergoing orthodontic treatment over 24 months. however, further studies are needed to clarify the major cell phenotype associated with the immune response. the nickel allergy comprises type iv hypersensitivity reactions which are cell-mediated by t lymphocytes. these cells are an important component of the immune response to many intracellular pathogens and some nondegradable antigens. these reactions are initiated by cd4+ t lymphocytes with the accumulation of macrophages, and other effector cells in response to t cell cytokines. the efficiency of metallic nickel or nickel compound phagocytosis by the macrophages or giant cells depends on the size and surface changes of the nickel particles. these cells are also of central importance in the induction of antigen-specific t lymphocyte activation. microscopically, in this study there were no differences between the inflammatory cells found in the groups with brackets that contained or did not contain nickel. at 14 days after bracket implantation, the presence of neutrophils, macrophages, and lymphocytes, and many blood vessels was observed. after this period, the inflammatory cells were gradually changed by fibroblasts and connective tissue. probably, the presence of inflammatory cells in the wound is related to insertion and removal procedures. authors have reported that the concentration of nickel liberated from orthodontic apparatus does not reach cytotoxic levels, and its concentration in serum and saliva from patients who wear fixed orthodontic appliances is similar to those found in healthy individuals. it can be suggested that the nickel in the orthodontic appliances was not enough to create a humoral response using the present methodology. nickel has a long-standing history of successful use in dentistry, and there are no significant reports of biological effects attributed to nickel-containing dental appliances and restorations.","{'answer_start': [635], 'text': ['type iv hypersensitivity reactions']}",,pathology,"{'authors': ['Cássio Vicente Pereira', 'Estela Kaminagakura', 'Paulo Rogério Ferreti Bonan', 'Renata Avelar Bastos', 'Luciano José Pereira'], 'doi': 'https://doi.org/10.2319/122906-536.1', 'meta': 'Angle Orthod (2008) 78 (1): 114–119.', 'title': 'Cellular, Humoral, and Histopathologic Analysis in Rats Implanted with Orthodontic Nickel Brackets'}",8d3d6f3d-e020-410e-9cfd-5d0c2286f723
what can cause adenoid or tonsil size to increase?,"when it is evident that enlarged tonsils and adenoids are etiological factors in the open-bite malocclusion, positive preventive measures can be taken. in a study of two hundred fourteen children between the ages of four and five, hansen, bernard and observed that the tonsil and adenoid problem has a bearing on the growth and development of the orofacial structures. unfortunately, the orthodontist is placed in a difficult position because he usually does not encounter the open bite problem during the early stages of development before a permanent skeletal deformity has been established. under no circumstances should the dental practitioner assume the responsibility for advising the removal of the tonsils and adenoids. however, he should be able to recognize the presence of abnormally large tonsils and be knowledgeable as to the medical and dental reasons why the removal may be indicated. the family physician ultimately has to assume the responsibility for advising the surgical procedure. normally, as an infant advances in age, a rapid hyperplasia of the tonsil and adenoid tissue occurs, and generally there is an atrophy of the tissue as the child grows older. the function of the lymphoid tissue is to act as a mechanism for the filtration of bacteria, and the atrophy or hyperplasia of the tissue depends on the demands made on it. mainly, the two factors which cause the tonsil and adenoid tissue to persist or to increase in size are chronic infection of the tonsils and adenoids and allergic reactions. the enlarged lymphoid tissue can cause an obstruction of the nasopharynx which in turn interferes with the nasorespiratory and masticatory functions. the malfunctions of the nasopharynx can influence the growth patterns of the surrounding hard and soft tissues. an obstruction by the enlarged adenoid tissue is generally reflected by a high, narrow palate and a constricted maxillary arch, which can cause a displacement of the nasal septum followed by a partial or complete obliteration of the choanal openings. the adenoid problem primarily affects tures of the maxilla and the upper face. on the other hand, the mechanical obstruction of the nasopharynx by tonsillar tissue can cause a deviation in the pattern of swallowing which can struction of the nasopharynx by tonsillar tissue can cause a deviation in the pattern of swallowing which can influence the growth patterns of both the maxilla and mandible.","{'answer_start': [1455], 'text': ['chronic infection of the tonsils and adenoids and allergic reactions']}",,clinical,"{'authors': ['M.

"regarding lip bumper therapy, what is the effect on mandibular incisors?","the lip bumper, a rigid tooth-borne appliance that holds the lower lip away from the anterior teeth, has achieved common usage in many orthodontic circles. its purpose is to reduce lower anterior crowding, increase arch circumference and move the permanent molars distally. when its treatment goals are met, it can simplify the banded phase of treatment and decrease the need for extracting permanent teeth since tooth-size/arch-size discrepancies have been reduced or eliminated. use of the lip bumper may also shorten treatment time and enhance stability of the result. arch changes produced by the lip bumper have been investigated, but until recently the focus has been on documenting mesial movement of the incisors and distal movement of the molars. cetlin and ten hoeve and len hoeve showed that increase in arch circumference is due in large part to increase in arch width. nevant and osborn described the use of lip bumpers as adjuncts to fixed appliance treatment. they reported labial tipping of the incisor crowns, distal tipping of the molar crowns, and an increase in arch width. nevant also reported a significant decrease in incisor irregularity. subjects in these studies were treated by multiple clinicians without consistency of lip bumper fabrication or uniformity of age at treatment.","{'answer_start': [989], 'text': ['labial tipping of the incisor crowns']}",,clinical,"{'authors': ['Scott P.

"in patient with hemifacial microsomia, what is the main source of variability in the efficacy of functional appliances?","hemifacial microsomia is a congenital abnormality which results in progressive, three-dimensiona facial asymmetry in the growing child. functional appliance therapy was instituted 11 year, 7 month old boy with hemifacial microsomia in order to determine if symmetry could be re-established by promoting masticatory muscle function on the affected side, thereby stimulating bone growth in the affected condyle over and above what would occur without any treatment intervention. removable functional appliance therapy, and later, unilateral herbst appliance therapy, produced a dramatic change in the condylar growth on the affected side. herbst therapy has the advantage over a removable functional appliance in that patient acceptance is much greater. lack of patient compliance may be the primary cause of the variable results obtained with functional appliances in hemifacial microsomia cases as reported in the literature. microsomia is defined as an undersized state of the body or body one of the primary features of hemifacial microsomia (previously known as first arch syndrome or first and second branchial arch syndrome) is unilateral failure of formation or underdevelopment of the mandibular ramus and/or condyle and the associated muscles of mastication? the maxilla and malar bones on the ipsilateral side are frequently underdeveloped. failure of the affected side to grow downward and forward results in the three downward and forward results in the three dimensional asymmetry: the mandibular skeletal midline deviates to the affected side; unilateral hypoplasia results in mandibular retrognathia; and lack of vertical growth on the affected side produces a tilting of the occlusal plane as viewed from the frontal aspect. the severity of the deformity varies from mild to severe. epker and fish report that the more severe the congenital deformity, the more likely it will worsen with growth. ware states that although conventional orthodontic tooth movement is of little value in prepubertal patients with hemifacial microsomia, efforts should be made to guide skeletal growth and stimulate the affected areas. harvold et al first suggested that functional appliance therapy may have a stimulatory effect on muscle development and would prevent canting of the occlusal plane. according to epker and fish, the response to functional appliances is not predictable in prepubertal hemifacial microsomia patients. they report that the less severe the three dimensional deformity, and the more normal the mandibular movements, the greater the likelihood of a favorable response to functional appliance therapy.","{'answer_start': [752], 'text': ['lack of patient compliance may be the primary cause of the variable results obtained with functional appliances in hemifacial microsomia']}",,clinical,"{'authors': ['Ross G.

"regarding the biology of tooth movement, which forces allows for tipping and bodily movement without causing undermining resorption?","the first record of a force moving a tooth was reported by the roman celsus who suggested that, after the loss of a deciduous tooth, daily exertion of finger pressure to a permanent tooth could move it to its proper position. in 1904 first recorded the histological aspects of tooth movement. in addition to direct bone resorption on the pressure surfaces, he described undermining resorption which he found with orthodontic forces of large magnitude. in his concept of undermining resorption, excessive pressure constricted the blood supply to the periodontium causing localized necrosis. tooth movement could not proceed until this necrosed tissue was removed by phagocytic action. oppenheim reported the direct bone resorbing effect of light forces and the effect of heavy forces with resulting undermining resorption. he found that undermining resorption produced by heavy forces of 240 to 360 grams per tooth was less desirable than the direct resorption of lighter forces. he also felt that intermittency of force would reduce undermining resorption. schwartz in 1932 found that tooth movement would occur with a force as light as that of capillary blood pressure (20 to 26 grams/cm2). he felt light continuous forces were best as this prevented the formation of resorption-resistant osteoid bone. reitan found that tipping and bodily movements could be made with a force of 40 to 50 grams per tooth, but when the force reached 100 to 150 grams, undermining resorption occurred. aisenberg found that the amount of force applied to a tooth changes the position of the fulcrum and thus changes the type of movement obtained and, likewise, a change in the nature of resorption obtained. halderson, john, and moyers proposed that forces should work within the limits of tissue tolerance and that excessive forces yielded only a pathologic response. stuteville and hemley suggested that movements be of no greater range than the width of the periodontal membrane.","{'answer_start': [1370], 'text': ['a force of 40 to 50 grams per tooth']}",,biology,"{'authors': ['DAVID L.

"in patients affected by rheumatoid arthritis (ra), which process causes an anterior open bite?","rheumatoid arthritis (ra) is an autoimmune disease that causes chronic inflammation in joint tissues; it is usually seen in other joints prior to temporomandibular joint (tmj) involvement. the common clinical findings in ra of the tmj are tenderness, pain, clicking, crepitation, stiffness, and limitation in jaw movements. in patients with progressive disease, the joint space becomes obliterated due to loss of condylar height and retrognathia, and an anterior open bite deformity occurs due to destruction, erosion, sclerosis, and flattening of the articular surface of the condyle and eminence. these patients occasionally require a surgical approach, such as tmj replacement therapy or costochondral grafting of the tmj to solve the anterior open bite deformity. however, condylar resorption in ra is multifactorial, based on the patient's adaptive capacity and on mechanical stimuli. when predisposing patient factors are not present, occlusal treatments (orthodontics, orthognathic surgery, prosthetics) normally result in functioning remodeling. tmj is changeable, and changes in occlusion and mandibular position resulting from forces generated during orthodontic/orthognathic manipulations can contribute to remodeling of the articular structures of the tmj. we report the case of an ra patient in remission with an open bite deformity who had severely eroded articular surfaces of both condyles and in whom occlusion was orthodontically reconstructed. considerable improvement of the tmj condition has been sustained after approximately 4 years of follow-up.","{'answer_start': [497], 'text': ['destruction, erosion, sclerosis, and flattening of the articular surface of the condyle and eminence']}",,pathology,"{'authors': ['Kenichi Sasaguri', 'Rika Ishizaki-Takeuchi', 'Sakurako Kuramae', 'Eliana Midori Tanaka', 'Takashi Sakurai', 'Sadao Sato'], 'doi': 'https://doi.org/10.2319/040708-201.1', 'meta': 'Angle Orthod (2009) 79 (4): 804–811.', 'title': 'The Temporomandibular Joint in a Rheumatoid Arthritis Patient after Orthodontic Treatment'}",00847d3a-a089-44bb-9be2-a2a452d5b5d0
"regarding bonding materials, what is the mechanism of a self-etching primer?","a unique characteristic of some new bonding systems in operative dentistry is that they combine conditioning and priming agents into a single acidic primer solution for simultaneous use on both enamel and dentin. combining conditioning and priming into a single treatment step results in improvement in both time and cost-effectiveness for clinicians as well as for patients. in a self-etching primer, the active ingredient is a methacrylated phosphoric acid ester. the phosphoric acid and the methacrylate group are combined into a molecule that etches and primes at the same time. the phosphate group on the methacrylated phosphoric acid ester dissolves the calcium and removes it from the hydroxyapatite. but rather than being rinsed away, the calcium forms a complex with the phosphate group and gets incorporated into the network when the primer polymerizes. agitating the primer on the tooth surface serves to ensure that fresh primer is transported to the enamel surface. etching and monomer penetration to the exposed enamel rods are simultaneous. in this manner, the depth of the etch is identical to that of the primer penetration. three mechanisms act to stop the etching process. first, the acid groups attached to the etching monomer are neutralized in a similar way, as is phosphoric acid, by forming a complex with the calcium from the hydroxyapatite. second, as the solvent is driven from the primer during the airburst step, the viscosity rises, slowing the transport of acid groups to the enamel interface. finally, as the primer is light cured and the primer monomers are polymerized, transport of acid groups to the interface is stopped. these new systems were also found to be effective when bonding the brackets to the enamel. in recent laboratory studies on acidic primers by bishara et al, two different acidic primers for restorative dentistry and/or adhesives for restorative dentistry and orthodontics were tested. the results indicated that both self-etching primer systems resulted in significantly reduced bond strength values. it was suggested that more research was needed to determine whether currently available orthodontic adhesive systems could be used with an acidic primer.","{'answer_start': [583], 'text': ['the phosphate group on the methacrylated phosphoric acid ester dissolves the calcium and removes it from the hydroxyapatite. but rather than being rinsed away, the calcium forms a complex with the phosphate group and gets incorporated into the network when the primer polymerizes']}",,materials,"{'authors': ['Tamer Buyukyilmaz, DDS, MSD', 'Serdar Usumez, DDS, PhD', 'Ali Ihya Karaman, DDS, PhD'], 'doi': 'https://doi.org/10.1043/0003-3219(2003)073<0064:EOSEPO>2.0.CO;2', 'meta': 'Angle Orthod (2003) 73 (1): 64–70.', 'title': 'Effect of Self-Etching Primers on Bond Strength—Are They Reliable?'}",524c0351-07ff-4266-9bc1-4eb8d67b5cc3

"in patients with impacted canines, which exposure technique is suggested if an impacted canine is positioned at the center of the alveolus?","although this study has reported several significant findings, some limitations should be mentioned. first, the sample did not allow direct comparisons between the two surgical techniques since the two groups could not be strictly matched. second, a larger sample size would allow segregation of the groups according to pretreatment severity of impaction. this would help to elucidate the role of initial tooth position on the periodontal and esthetic outcomes of treatment. finally, the method error for the clinical variables was small in this study. this could suggest examiner bias since all measurements were performed at only one session. however, the test and control teeth were in the same subject, and since they were exposed to the same bias, this would maximize the accuracy of comparisons between the two teeth. it is apparent from the results of this study that more periodontal and esthetic disadvantages may be expected with the apically positioned flap technique than with the closed-eruption technique. accordingly, the indications for use of the apically positioned flap technique may be questioned. the vertical and horizontal position of the impacted tooth and the amount of gingiva have been used by some surgeons to determine the appropriate technique. if the tooth is impacted in the middle of the alveolus or high in the vestibule near the nasal spine, the closed-eruption technique may be the treatment of choice. however, if the tooth requires more attached gingiva or is displaced lateral to the edentulous area, an apically positioned flap may be the best choice. future studies are needed to validate these suggested criteria.","{'answer_start': [989], 'text': ['the closed-eruption technique']}",,clinical,"{'authors': ['Michael E.

"regarding the segmented arch technique for space closure, what is the require moment to force ratio (m/f) to achieve root movement?","orthodontists accomplish space closure in different ways, depending on the diagnosis and treatment plan. frictionless systems of space closure are superior to systems which introduce friction as a means of space closure. an appliance system without friction allows greater control of tooth movement during space closure. specialized precalibrated springs for space closure are an integral part of the segmented arch technique. precalibrated attraction springs have three characteristics of interest: 1) the alpha (anterior) moment produced by the spring; 2) the beta (posterior) moment produced by the spring; and 3) the horizontal force generated. the type of movement is dictated by the moment to force ratio (m/f) generated by the appliance at the attachments. typically, m/f ratios of approximately 7:1 millimeters result in controlled tipping, 10:1 millimeters result in translational movements, and values of 12:1 millimeters or greater accomplish root movement. these ratios are based on the assumptions that the root lengths are 12 millimeters, the distance from the bracket slot to the alveolar crest is five millimeters, the alveolar bone condition is normal, the axial inclination of the teeth is normal, and the center of resistance is located apically a distance .40 times the root length when measured from the alveolar crest to the apex. the variation of the center of resistance with differing levels of bony support is shown in figure 1. with a change in the center of resistance the m/f ratio must be modified (figure 2); thus, in adult patients with periodontal loss, higher m/f values must be attained.","{'answer_start': [915], 'text': ['12:1 millimeters or greater']}",,biomechanics,"{'authors': ['Clemens Manhartsberger, DDS, MD', 'John Y.

"regarding the biological limits of tooth movement, what is the implication of gingival inflammtion on facial movement of mandibular incisors?","although the periodontal goal of orthodontic tooth movement is physiologic remodelling of the alveolar bone, it must be acknowledged that in almost all instances the tissue reaction to tooth movement is more akin to controlled pathology. in the early days of orthodontics, it was hoped that orthodontic treatment, by improving the dental occlusion, would promote or enhance periodontal health. at present, the goal for periodontally healthy individuals is to solve their orthodontic problems without causing irreversible damage to the periodontium. current views about periodontic-orthodontic interrelationships have been summarized by vanarsdall and wennstrom. at a fundamental level, periodontal pathogenesis is strongly related to the bacterial flora and how an individual manages it (in terms of both hygiene and immune competence). because individual patients have varying susceptibility to loss of the attachment apparatus, it is important for the orthodontist to evaluate this when treatment is planned. for example, a patient with thin, friable tissue and little attached gingiva on the labial of a mandibular incisor is at risk for gingival recession if the tooth is moved facially out of its alveolar bone housing. if this labial tooth movement is accompanied by inflammation due to plaque retention there is even greater risk of recession. if the tissue is thin or if there is inadequate attached gingiva, there may be merit in prophylactically augmenting the tissue with mucogingival surgery and the placement of a split-thickness gingival graft. gingiva that has been augmented in this manner appears clinically to be more resistant to recession. tweed attempted to show with sectioned orthodontic casts that the labial plate of alveolar bone and gingiva in the mandibular incisor region becomes thinner if the incisors are moved labially, and this hypothesis was confirmed histologically in monkeys by wennstrom. no one has quantified how far labially mandibular incisors can be moved without significantly increasing the risk of recession, and obviously this would depend on the condition of the tissues initially. the anatomy of the alveolar bone and soft tissues in the area suggests that 2 to 3 mm would be the limit for most patients. the risk of gingival recession and dehiscence of the alveolar bone is not limited to the mandibular incisor area. herberger has shown increased gingival recession on the facial surfaces of maxillary premolars and molars in patients treated with rapid palatal even with excellent separation of the midpalatal suture, displacement of the teeth occurs within the alveolar process, and the greater the tooth movement the greater the chance of endangering the periodontium. dehiscences and fenestrations of the labial alveolar plate often are noted intraoperatively, presumably as a result of presurgical orthodontic treatment. in short, it behooves the orthodontist to recognize periodontal susceptibility, control gingival inflammation during orthodontic tooth movement, augment thin gingiva in a preventive fashion when indicated, and move teeth facially less than 2 to 3 mm in a periodontally resistant individual and not at all in a periodontally susceptible patient.","{'answer_start': [1310], 'text': ['there is even greater risk of recession']}",,clinical,"{'authors': ['James L.

"regarding craniofacial growth, where are the vertical elements of growth in the face?","what are these vertical elements of growth? specifically where are the increments which produce an increase in facial height? they are as follows: (fig. 3) (1) growth at nasion and in the corpus of the maxilla which produces an increase in the distance from nasion to anterior nasal spine and causes the maxillary molars and posterior nasal spine to move away from the sella-nasion plane, (2) growth of the maxillary posterior alveolar processes causing the molar teeth to move away from the palatal plane, and (3) growth at the mandibular posterior alveolar processes causing the molar teeth to move occlusally. the vertical growth of the anterior alveolar processes does not seem to have an appreciable effect on facial height. it is merely expressed in varying degrees of overbite. the dorsal migration of the glenoid fossa is a very real factor in many cases and tends to cancel out the growth of the condyles; thus, in a sense it is arrayed on the side of vertical growth. surface additions of bone at pogonion usually have an insignificant effect, but occasionally we do see quite appreciable apposition in this area, clockwise rotation of the mandible is a result of more posterior vertical growth than condylar growth, the point of rotation being the condyles. we know that when vertical growth exceeds horizontal growth, (condylar growth) pogonion cannot keep pace with the forward growth of the upper face and the mandibular plane must become steeper (fig. 2). what effect does this type of growth have upon treatment? obviously this condition would not help reduce the anb angle, and it would not aid in correction of a class ii molar relation. however, it would tend to help correct the vertical overbite of the incisors. many such growth patterns actually do reduce the vertical overbite, perhaps the majority do not. there is ample evidence to show that dominance of vertical growth of the face facilitates the correction and retention of vertical overbite.","{'answer_start': [156], 'text': ['(1) growth at nasion and in the corpus of the maxilla which produces an increase in the distance from nasion to anterior nasal spine and causes the maxillary molars and posterior nasal spine to move away from the sella-nasion plane, (2) growth of the maxillary posterior alveolar processes causing the molar teeth to move away from the palatal plane, and (3) growth at the mandibular posterior alveolar processes causing the molar teeth to move occlusally']}",,growth,"{'authors': ['F.

"in patients with anterior crossbite, what are the two types of malocclusion that are suspected?","patients with anterior crossbites are usually suspected to have skeletal class iii malocclusion, which can be subdivided into true class iii malocclusion of skeletal origin and pseudo-class iii of dental origin. in this study, cephalometric analysis of children with class iii malocclusion and those with normal occlusion in the same age group was performed to identify defining characteristics of class iii malocclusion in the deciduous dentition. to exclude children with pseudo-class iii malocclusion of dental origin, only patients with concave profiles were included. traditionally, guiding the mandible forward to anterior edge-to-edge bite was the key to judge pseudo-class iii malocclusion. however, in reality, most patients with anterior crossbite in deciduous dentition can guide their mandible forward to anterior edge-to-edge bite. therefore, the method of mandibular forward guidance was not used for this study. according to a study by tollaro et al, patients with class iii malocclusion exhibit unique craniofacial characteristics from the early ages of deciduous dentition. in accordance with this, our study discovered statistically significant differences in many cephalometric measurements between normal and class iii children with deciduous dentition. sagittal skeletal analysis showed highly significant differences between groups in all measurements except maxillary length and snb angle. in most deciduous dentition patients with anterior crossbites, functional deviation of the mandible is common during centric occlusion. this deviation can result in significant error in measurements dictated by mandibular position, such as anb difference, wits, facial convexity, and pogonion to n-perpendicular. for this reason, our study instead compared measurements that are independent of mandibular position, such as mandibular length, sna, a point to n-perpendicular, and mandibular body to anterior cranial base ratio. results showed that the difference in maxillary size was insignificant between the two groups. however, a point to n-perpendicular and mandibular body to anterior cranial base ratio showed that the class iii group had retrognathic maxillas and significantly larger mandibles compared to those of the normal group. similar differences were also reported in studies by tollaro et al10 and chang et al. in another study by mouakeh et al on adults with class iii malocclusion, approximately 45.3% showed protrusive mandibles, 33% showed a retrusive maxilla, and 9.5% showed a combination of these two findings. in addition, guyer et al reported that 57% of patients with class iii malocclusion showed retrusive maxillas. in a different study on etiology, sanborn hypothesized that class iii malocclusion during the deciduous dentition years is due to mandibular prognathism in 23% of cases and to a retrusive maxilla in 26%. in this study, according to cephalometric analysis, approximately 50% of patients had prognathic mandibles, 20% had retrognathic maxillas, and 30% had a combination of prognathic mandible and retrognathic maxilla. in contrast to previous studies, our data indicate that an oversized mandible is the cause of class iii malocclusion in almost 80% of the cases. this may be explained by our selection of patients with potential skeletal class iii malocclusion from all patients with anterior crossbites. in addition, the racial difference of oriental origin in our sample could have affected the results.","{'answer_start': [126], 'text': ['true class iii malocclusion of skeletal origin and pseudo-class iii of dental origin']}",,clinical,"{'authors': ['Hyung-Jun Choi', 'Ji-Yeon Kim', 'Seung Eun Yoo', 'Jang-Hyuk Kwon', 'Kitae Park'], 'doi': 'https://doi.org/10.2319/120108-605.1', 'meta': 'Angle Orthod (2010) 80 (1): 86–90.', 'title': 'Cephalometric Characteristics of Korean Children with Class III Malocclusion in the Deciduous Dentition'}",d132399a-40f6-4313-9b48-813caecdf9e6

"in normal subjects, what is the position of the condyle in centric relation (cr)?","the optimal position of the condyle in the glenoid fossa is a fundamental question in dentistry. controversy persists over the clinical significance of condylar position in the temporomandibular joint (tmj). the condylar position is an end product of many dynamic changes, such as growth, remodeling, responses to functional changes and occlusal alterations. concentric condylar position is considered a normal relationship between the condyle and fossa and is usually found in asymptomatic participants. nonconcentric condyle-fossa relationships have been associated with abnormal tmj function. however, in other studies, the presence or absence of temporomandibular disorder (tmd) did not correlate with the condyle position in the tmj. centric relation (cr) is defined as a musculoskeletal stable maxillomandibular relationship, with the condyles in the anterosuperior position against the slope of the articular eminence, centered transversely and with the articular disc properly interposed, while centric occlusion (co) or maximum intercuspal position is a dentally determined position. there can be a significant difference in the occlusion when it is dictated by the teeth versus when it is dictated by the condyles. in diagnosis and treatment planning for orthodontic patients co-cr discrepancies are of clinical significance. there may be a direct correlation between co-cr discrepancies and the probability that a patient will develop tmd.","{'answer_start': [857], 'text': ['anterosuperior position against the slope of the articular eminence, centered transversely and with the articular disc properly interposed']}",,anatomy,"{'authors': ['Jong-Moon Chae', 'Jae Hyun Park', 'Kiyoshi Tai', 'Kyosuke Mizutani', 'Satoshi Uzuka', 'Wataru Miyashita', 'Hye Young Seo'], 'doi': 'https://doi.org/10.2319/052919-369.1', 'meta': 'Angle Orthod (2020) 90 (2): 224–232.', 'title': 'Evaluation of condyle-fossa relationships in adolescents with various skeletal patterns using cone-beam computed tomography'}",efc0caad-1088-4dbb-8c40-4fd1b18acdec
"in mixed dentition, what is the effect of the loss of a primary canine on arch space?","eruption. since early loss can accelerate or delay eruption of the succedaneous tooth, this can affect eruption, sequence and timing. it will alter position of the permanent tooth but only in a special circumstance: following very early loss of a second primary molar, the permanent first molar may erupt mesially. otherwise, space loss associated with drift is primarily a posteruption phenomenon. drift. early loss leads to vertical drift of the opposing primary tooth and to mesiodistal drift of the permanent molars and incisors; it rarely leads to buccolingual drift of permanent or primary teeth. mesial drift of the permanent molars is a well-recognized phenomenon. it is not well-recognized that (a) mesial or distal drift of primary teeth rarely occurs. if a first primary molar is lost prematurely space loss is unlikely (though possible). when space loss does occur in this circumstance, distal movement of the anterior segment is as likely as mesial movement of the posterior segment. an intact primary second molar or canine, in other words, is in itself a good space maintainer; (b) distal drift of permanent incisors is as much to be expected as mesial drift of molars. early loss of primary canines almost invariably leads to space loss by distal movement of the permanent incisors, not by mesial movement of the primary and permanent molars. equilibrium. only minor equilibrium effects are associated with early loss. forces generated in the periodontal lignament are not affected, but resting tongue and lip pressure may be. the tongue will tend to partially occupy a space in the dental arch and lip posture may be affected by early loss of primary incisors. an altered chewing pattern, to avoid the side where a tooth is missing, may result. there is little or no evidence, however, that these possible changes will influence tooth position significantly.","{'answer_start': [1242], 'text': ['space loss by distal movement of the permanent incisors']}",,clinical,"{'authors': ['JAMES L.

"regarding biomechanics in orthodontics, how is the effective moment calculated?","fundamental physics teaches that the shortest perpendicular distance between a force vector and the center of resistance of a body determines the center of rotation. figure 5 illustrates these principles as they apply to headgear systems. regardless of the design of the facebow or j hook, the body (tooth) reacts to the force system of the headgear that is computed by figuring the shortest perpendicular distance from the force vector to the center of resistance. this distance dictates how the tooth moves and, more specifically, where the instantaneous center of rotation will be (fig. 6). fig. 5 in order to determine the moment in a headgear problem, choose any point (o) and determine the moments acting around it. conclusion: force times its perpendicular distance to the center of resistance equals the effective moment. while positions of molars undergoing extraoral headgear treatment may change, the source of the extraoral force usually does not, the effect of changing molar positions is most noticeable when movement involves rotation. therefore, when the molar is rotating or tipping, the perpendicular distance between the headgear force vector and the molar center of resistance may change. when this distance is altered, the instantaneous center of rotation is also altered. it is possible through this phenomenon to reduce rotation tendencies as the molar begins to change position.","{'answer_start': [734], 'text': ['force times its perpendicular distance to the center of resistance equals the effective moment']}",,biomechanics,"{'authors': ['FRANK W.

"regarding subjects with temporomandibular joint (tmj) disorders, what are the clinical signs and symptoms associated with internal derangement (tmj-id)?","the diagnosis and treatment of temporomandibular joint (tmj) disorders are controversial. one disorder type, which is related to disc-condyle disharmony, is called temporomandibular joint internal derangement (tmj-id). clinical signs and symptoms such as limitation of mouth opening, sounds (clicking, crepitation, grading, and grinding), deviation, deflection during mouth opening, and closing and lateral excursion all characterize tmj-id. disc displacement with reduction occurs when the disc is placed anteriorly relative to the condyle and the condyle passes over the thick posterior band of the disc at the beginning of mouth opening. painful clicking may occur at this time. once maximum opening has occurred, the condyle can capture the disc, and a normal relationship occurs between the condyle and the disc at this stage. however, in maximum intercuspation, the disc once more becomes situated anterior to the condyle. functional clinical examination methods are commonly used for the diagnosis of tmj-id. however, it has been reported1 that a clinical examination for the diagnosis of anterior disc displacement with reduction has an accuracy of 43 75%. this suggests that a clinical examination should be utilized together with other imaging methods in order to determine the relationship between the disc and condyle before and after treatment. arthrography and computed tomography are 2 imaging methods generally employed for diagnosis of a tmj-id. in recent years, magnetic resonance imaging (mri) has been used because it is a noninvasive method that does not appear to cause any biological hazard.","{'answer_start': [255], 'text': ['limitation of mouth opening, sounds (clicking, crepitation, grading, and grinding), deviation, deflection during mouth opening, and closing and lateral excursion']}",,pathology,"{'authors': ['Hatice Gökalp, DDS, PhD', 'Hakan Türkkahraman, DDS'], 'doi': 'https://doi.org/10.1043/0003-3219(2000)070<0400:CIPOTT>2.0.CO;2', 'meta': 'Angle Orthod (2000) 70 (5): 400–408.', 'title': 'Changes in Position of the Temporomandibular Joint Disc and Condyle After Disc Repositioning Appliance Therapy: A Functional Examination and Magnetic Resonance Imaging Study'}",48226c58-cd09-41f8-8585-f733b361c681
"during active treatment with rapid maxillary expansion and fixed appliances, what is the gain in mandibular arch perimeter?","in the short term, after rme and fixed appliance therapy, the tg presented with significant changes in all arch dimensions when compared with normal controls (table 2). both maxillary and mandibular arch widths and depths showed significant increases in the treated sample. during active treatment, the maxillary arch width at both intermolar and intercanine measures demonstrated an average increment of about four mm, whereas the increases in mandibular arch widths range between one and two mm. with regard to the gain in arch perimeters, 6.5 mm of increase in the maxillary arch was associated with four mm of increase in the mandibular arch. during the posttreatment period, very slight changes occurred in the arch width measurements both in the maxilla and mandible of the treated subjects (table 2). on the contrary, a rather substantial tendency to relapse occurred in the arch perimeters ( 3.5 mm in the maxillary arch and 2.5 mm in the mandibular arch) after active treatment. in the overall observation period, the increase for maxillary intermolar width was 4.5 mm and one mm for mandibular intermolar width. the increase in maxillary arch perimeter was three mm, whereas the increase in mandibular arch perimeter was 1.5 mm. these increments may appear limited in amount and clinical significance. however, the findings need to be interpreted by taking into consideration the actual changes that occur in a sample of untreated subjects in the long term. in a time period of about eight years that covers approximately the late mixed and early permanent dentitions, an average decrease of three mm is observed in untreated subjects in both maxillary and mandibular arch perimeters. the results of the present study confirm previous data by brust and mcnamara10 in this regard.","{'answer_start': [603], 'text': ['four mm of increase in the mandibular arch']}",,clinical,"{'authors': ['James A.

"regarding face-mask therapy, what can be said of the effectiveness of the treatment after 10 years of age?","this study was a very good effort by the authors. but there are certain issues to be clarified. in the present study, the mean age of the rme group was 12 years 9 months of which 8 were girls. most of the authors including the authors of the present study, recommend the face mask therapy to be completed by 10 years of age. a meta analysis by kim et al. indicated that face mask is less effective in patients who are older than 10 years of age. that indicates that growth completion could have been one of the reasons that reduced effectiveness of facemask therapy in rme group. in addition, some authors do not concur on the usefulness of rme along with facemask therapy. a randomized controlled trial by gregory vaughan et al. showed no difference between expansion and no expansion groups in facemask therapy. they concluded that early facemask therapy with or without expansion is effective to correct skeletal class iii. in the current study, while one group (rme) underwent a procedure intended to separate the two halves of the maxilla and thereby aid in their protraction, the other group underwent a definite surgical procedure like le fort i osteotomy (albeit incomplete) that eased out maxilla from the rest of the bones that would definitely aid in protraction therapy. further, the rme group was somewhat older than the recommended age for the procedure. the results of the study were therefore very much predictable. however, we sincerely congratulate the authors for a fine effort, especially for the results of the surgical group which were very impressive.","{'answer_start': [370], 'text': ['face mask is less effective in patients who are older than 10 years of age']}",,clinical,"{'authors': ['Mahesh Kumar Yethadka', 'Sharath Kumar Shetty'], 'doi': 'https://doi.org/10.2319/0003-3219-81.2.357', 'meta': 'Angle Orthod (2011) 81 (2): 357.', 'title': 'Re: Rapid maxillary expansion compared to surgery for assistance in maxillary face mask protraction.

"regarding the growth and maturation of the cranial base, what is the mean age of complete fusion of the spheno-occipital synchondrosis?","patients in the current sample were all growing individuals, with 36 of the patients showing an open spheno-occipital synchondrosis; only four had completely fused synchondroses. however, large variability was observed in the degree of maturation of the spheno-occipital synchondrosis. although some patients had a completely open spheno-occipital synchondrosis, in other patients at the same stage of cervical vertebral skeletal maturation (cvm), the spheno-occipital synchondrosis was completely or almost completely fused. according to a recently proposed method of scoring the stages of synchondrosis fusion, patients in the current sample had the following pattern of maturation: eight patients in stage 1, seven in stage 2, eight in stage 3, 12 in stage 4, and four patients in stage 5. however, the association between cvm and synchondrosis maturation was not found, as reported previously. the explanation for such variability in synchondrosis maturation in these 12- to 16-year-old patients can be found by the conclusions presented by melsen, who found that the age of complete fusion of the spheno-occipital synchondrosis is variable, occurring by 16 to 17 years of age in women and at 18 to 19 years in men. ford commented that, in some individuals, the spheno-occipital synchondrosis might continue to grow until the age of 20 to 25 years of age. in a recent study using 3d images, sinanoglu et al. showed that the mean age for complete fusion of the spheno-occipital synchondrosis was 18 and 20 years for women and men, respectively. regardless of the degree of maturity of the spheno-occipital synchondrosis, after the analysis of 40 patients with growth between 12 and 16 years of age, 20 in the treated group and 20 in the comparison group, the current data showed that there were no visual or clinically significant changes (the color-mapping scale was set to identify differences greater than 0.5 mm) in the three planes of space in the posterior region of the cranial base relative to the anterior cranial fossa. recently, stepanko and lagrav re reported no clinically significant changes in the sphenoid bone due to rapid maxillary expansion treatments regardless of gender or treatment type, which is in agreement with the evidence collected in the current investigation. in this study, most of the measurements did not show statistically significant differences in displacements and rotations between the treated and comparison groups. only four measurements showed statistically significant differences between the two groups, but these differences were not clinically significant. for those variables, the mean differences between the two groups were very small, ie, within the computer margin of error of landmark selection (0.5 mm), or the voxel size (0.3 mm).","{'answer_start': [1424], 'text': ['the mean age for complete fusion of the spheno-occipital synchondrosis was 18 and 20 years for women and men, respectively']}",,growth,"{'authors': ['Karine Sayure Okano', 'Lucia Helena Soares Cevidanes', 'Paula Loureiro Cheib', 'Antonio Carlos de Oliveira Ruellas', 'Marília Yatabe', 'Tung Nguyen', 'Lorenzo Franchi', 'James A.

what is the effect of rapid maxillary expansion (rme) on nasal airway resistance and nasal breathing?,"the increase in the maxillary arch width (3 5 mm) seen in this study is similar to the results reported by most rme studies. the effect of rme on the nasal airways was investigated in this study because of the possible relationship between breathing patterns and nasal airway obstruction and ne. assessment of the nasal airway on the basis of conventional radiographs has limitations due to superimposition and lack of soft tissue detail. therefore, before and after rme, and in addition to clinical ent examinations, this study used ct scans to assess nasal obstruction. many researchers2 4 have reported that the nasal cavity width increases immediately following the rme. in this study, ct scans show an increase in the nasal cavity width after rme, at the level of the inferior concha. the increase in the width of the nose increases nasal capacity, as predicted by poiseuille's law: in every small duct, the flow varies by the fourth power of the radius. our ct scans showed notable improvement in patients suffering from mild to moderate nasal obstruction after rme. many investigators have reported that rme reduces nasal airway resistance and improves nasal breathing. the patients reported that their nasal breathing was improved and that there was a significant reduction in mouth breathing and snoring after rme. several reports mention ne as a common symptom among children with breathing problems and sleep apnea. improvement in ne is linked to improvement in breathing capacity and better oxygen saturation of blood. this may have a beneficial effect in restoration of normal sleep patterns and may cause the patient to wake up more easily. therefore, we can conclude that an improvement in the breathing caused by rme may lead to improvement in the sleep patterns of enuretic patients. this is confirmed in the present study, as significant improvements were found for deep sleep patients.","{'answer_start': [1115], 'text': ['reduces nasal airway resistance and improves nasal breathing']}",,clinical,"{'authors': ['Nameer Al-Taai', 'Fakhri Alfatlawi', 'Maria Ransjö', 'Saad Fakhry'], 'doi': 'https://doi.org/10.2319/031014-172.1', 'meta': 'Angle Orthod (2015) 85 (1): 102–108.', 'title': 'Effect of rapid maxillary expansion on monosymptomatic primary nocturnal enuresis'}",25885c65-df54-423b-8b7d-2bb9698ffe93
"regarding stainless steel alloys, what is formed when at least 10 to 13% chromium is present in the alloy?","with the advent of stainless steels in world war i and the refinement of drawing processes to form wires in the late 1930s, gold archwires gradually lost favor to the smaller cross-sectional areas that stainless steel archwires could provide. by the 1950s the type 300 series of stainless steel alloys were used for most orthodontic materials. these typically contained 17 to 25% chromium and 8 to 25% nickel, with the balance being iron. when at least 10 to 13% chromium was present in the alloy, a coherent oxide layer formed that passivated the surface, thereby rendering the alloy stainless. when at least 8% nickel was present, the single phase structure of austenite was stabilized, and the overall corrosion resistance was enhanced. carbon content was purposely maintained below 0.20% to reduce the formation of chromium carbides (figure 1), structures that can ultimately foster the corrosion of austenitic steels. stainless steels were strong, typically about five times stronger than structural girders, and their stiffnesses were 93 to 100% that of conventional carbon steels. these stainless steels were also sensitive to the products of incomplete combustion, such as those found in a sooty flame, and could not be cooled slowly through the temperature regime of 425 to 815c or else sensitization to corrosion could occur.

"in the segmented arch technique, what is the effect of the continuous intrusive arch on posterior teeth?","the use of j-hook and high-pull headgear associated with continuous archwires has been advocated for the treatment of deep overbite. although this treatment approach has considerable merit, a number of limitations are associated with the use of this appliance. the amount of force delivered to the maxillary anterior teeth is substantial and may result in significant resorption of the roots of the anterior teeth. the forces delivered by the headgear are also intermittent and the correction of the deep overbite is less efficient than with the use of continuous light forces. considerable patient cooperation is generally required. continuous intrusion arches with the segmented arch technique may be used to obtain genuine intrusion of the anterior teeth. a pure intrusive force is applied to the incisors using a 0.017"" x 0.025"" tma (ormco, glendora, calif) continuous intrusion arch tied to a rigid anterior segment of wire placed into the incisor brackets. this mechanism assures a point contact of force application to the anterior segment of teeth. pure incisor intrusion is obtained and flaring is controlled by tying back the intrusion arch at the molars. the posterior teeth tend to tip back and extrude. a rigid stainless steel palatal arch is usually placed to control molar position. extrusive forces and molar tipback are controlled with rigid buccal wire segments and, perhaps, high-pull headgear. the headgear pull is usually directed above the center of resistance of the molar to encourage the molar roots to move distally, maintaining a good molar axial inclination.","{'answer_start': [1166], 'text': ['the posterior teeth tend to tip back and extrude']}",,biomechanics,"{'authors': ['Bhavna Shroff, DDS, MDentSc', 'Won M.

(1975) also reported that the a-n-b angle is not always an accurate method of establishing the actual amount of apical base divergence. as an alternative to the angle for measuring apical base discrepancy, he devised the angle, where point x is formed by projecting point a onto a perpendicular to the s-n line, and point d is located in the bony symphysis as described by (steiner 1955). the two variables nasion and point b were eliminated. he also introduced a linear measurement a-d, to describe the a-p relationship of the jaws. point d, is the point which represents the shortest distance from point a on a line perpendicular to s-n passing through d. (fig. 2). jarvinen (1985) attributes the variation in the a-n-b angle to factors other than apical base difference, stating: the use of the apical base should be replaced by a better method to determine sagittal apical base the wits appraisal is the possible alternatives that he mentions as a replacement for this angle. relating the jaws anteroposteriorly to the cranial reference planes presents inherent inconsistencies because of variations in craniofacial physiognomy. the rotational effect and the anteroposterior positions of the jaws relative to the anterior cranial base are illustrated in figures 3, 4 and 5, and described at length in earlier publications 1975, 1976).","{'answer_start': [1511], 'text': ['inherent inconsistencies because of variations in craniofacial physiognomy']}",,clinical,"{'authors': ['Alex Jacobson'], 'doi': 'https://doi.org/10.1043/0003-3219(1988)058<0205:UOTWA>2.0.CO;2', 'meta': 'Angle Orthod (1988) 58 (3): 205–219.', 'title': 'Update on the Wits Appraisal'}",884f1c28-8d35-4135-8553-bfaf6130262b
"regarding temporomandibular joint changes following orthognathic surgery, what consists a risk factor for condylar resorption post-surgery?","overall, inward rotation after mandibular setback ssro or lefort i osteotomy with rigid fixation in skeletal class iii deformities induced condylar surface remodeling. this condylar rotation can lead to changes of the condylar surface (table 4). park et al. showed that bone resorption and bone formation occurred more frequently in specific areas after mandibular setback ssro and two-jaw surgery. in the present study, specific areas did not show distinct signs of bone remodeling. a previous study used multiplanar reformation images to evaluate condylar remodeling signs, reporting specific change sites (ie, resorption areas, anterior and superior areas on sagittal plane, superior and lateral areas on coronal plane, anterolateral and posterolateral areas on axial plane, bone formation area, and anteromedial area on axial plane). nonetheless, hwang et al. suggested that the posteriorly inclined condylar neck should be considered as a relevant nonsurgical risk factor in condylar resorption following orthognathic surgery. our study used 3d surface images, which could include all two-dimensional mpr images, because 3d surface images are more accurately representative of condylar head remodeling. from the comparison of 3d model accuracy between cbct and msct, the artifacts were mostly located at the mandibular border and the posterior margin of the scan volume, and they appeared at similar positions on all cbct systems. all comparisons were statistically significant, yet very small differences were obtained, which do not necessarily have a clinical significance. therefore, further studies should be needed for the various methodologies. the obtained data established that condylar remodeling had occurred after orthognathic surgery, thus effecting positional changes of the proximal segments. there were no specific remodeling signs in the condylar head. even though the inward rotation of the condylar axis was related to the condylar head remodeling, it was a part of the process of adaptation to the changed tmj environment. however, some anterior openbite cases appear to be sensitive to functional stress on the condyle, and so their adaptive capacity to the changed tmj environment probably is smaller than that of deep-bite cases. therefore, patients with predisposing factors of condylar adaptive capacities should be informed about the condylar remodeling, specifically condylar resorption and its adverse effects on skeletal stability and relapse.","{'answer_start': [883], 'text': ['posteriorly inclined condylar neck']}",,pathology,"{'authors': ['Soo-Bum An *', 'Soo-Byung Park *', 'Yong-Il Kim', 'Woo-Sung Son'], 'doi': 'https://doi.org/10.2319/052113-387.1', 'meta': 'Angle Orthod (2014) 84 (2): 316–321.', 'title': 'Effect of post–orthognathic surgery condylar axis changes on condylar morphology as determined by 3-dimensional surface reconstruction'}",cfbea599-b23b-4f94-abca-269d757846e6
"regarding round wire, how does the spring constant vary according to the cross sectional diameter?","confusion sometimes exists in relating resistance to permanent deformation and the rate of a spring. on the basis of feel, a clinician may believe that a spring made of soft steel wire has a lower spring rate than an identical spring fabricated of hard steel. it should be remembered that modulus of elasticity is virtually a constant for a given alloy and therefore, the rates of identical soft and hard steel wire springs are nearly the same. the difference in feel can be explained by the higher proportional limit of the hard wire which requires a greater total force to produce permanent deformation. in terms of design, the mechanical properties of a wire offer only limited potentialities. the maintenance of a given allowable load and a reduction in rate require an increase in the ratio of proportional limit to modulus of elasticity. at the present it is not possible to suggest any alloys that are significantly stainless steel or gold in respect to this ratio. perhaps, in the future new and superior alloys may be developed that can be applied to orthodontic springs. cross-sectional geometry: the change in rate which occurs as a result of altering the cross section of a spring wire is not simply proportional to the change in wire dimension or to the cross-sectional area, the resistance of a wire to bending and hence, its rate, is determined rather by the distribution of material around the neutral axis (figure 4). it can be demonstrated that a relatively small increase or decrease in the cross section of a wire may result in a marked increase or decrease in the load-deflection rate of an orthodontic spring. specifically, for round wire the constant increases as the fourth power of the diameter of the cross section. for instance, if an .010 and an .020 wire are deflected the same distance, the .020 wire exerts sixteen times as much force as the .010 wire although the diameter of the .020 wire is only twice as great. for square or rectangular wire the spring rate is only directly proportional to the width (b) of the cross section but increases as the cube of the depth (h). thus, a change in depth has a much more pronounced effect on the amount of force required for a given deflection than does a change in the width of the cross section. for instance, the result of decreasing the wire depth by half is to reduce the spring rate by a factor of eight but, if the width is decreased by the same amount, the rate is reduced only by a factor or two. similarly, it can be demonstrated that second order (occlusogingival) deflections in .021 x .025 wire require more than one and a half times the force needed for the same deflection in .018 x .025 wire.","{'answer_start': [1646], 'text': ['for round wire the constant increases as the fourth power of the diameter of the cross section']}",,materials,"{'authors': ['C.

"in patients with congenitally missing second molars, what occurs to the alveolar ridge after the extraction of the primary second molars?","a reflection on newly reported research findings will help answer the questions posed earlier in this paper. according to peck, et al., a number of dental anomalies are associated with the incidence of the palatally displaced canine. these range from differences the number and/or size of teeth to the presence of ectopically positioned teeth, as seen in these cases. the decision to treat case ja with a nonextraction approach seemed appropriate due to the lack of crowding, but according to woloshyn, et al., there are potential complications. surgical exposure and orthodontic alignment of palatally impacted canines is associated with a loss of periodontal support mesial of the canine and distal of the adjacent lateral incisor, and with root resorption of the adjacent lateral incisor and premolar. pulpal obliteration was found in more than 20% of the previously impacted canines. retention after treatment is also a concern, as approximately 40% of the aligned canines were judged to be intruded, lingually displaced, mesially rotated, or discolored, when evaluated over 3 years after treatment. in the future when looking for improved surgical techniques to aid in the alignment of displaced teeth, consideration should be given to closed eruption procedures. in their article (in this issue of the angle orthodontist) vermette et al. compared two groups of patients who were treated with different surgical techniques to expose unerupted anterior teeth. one group had an apically flap (apf) procedure and the other group had undergone the closed eruption (ce) technique. the authors concluded that anterior teeth uncovered with the apf technique were less esthetic those that were aligned with the closed eruption technique. the prospect for improved periodontal as well as esthetic benefits appears bright when this technique is used for displaced canines as well. the decision to retain the mandibular primary second molar in case eg was based on the excellent condition of the tooth and the expected retention problems until the patient was mature enough for a bridge or osseointegrated implant. ostler and kokich investigated alveolar ridge width changes following the extraction of primary second molars in patients who were congenitally missing second premolars. they found that the alveolar ridge narrowed by 25% during the first 3 years. however, most of the ridge loss occurred on the buccal surface and, because the primary molars are wider than their successors, the final ridge width was similar to the control premolar dimension. extraction of the primary molar would not necessarily jeopardize placement of an implant in that area. in this particular patient, extraction of the primary molar would also have improved posterior occlusion on the affected side. the long-term stability of maxillary median diastema closure is an ongoing concern for any clinician. both of these patients had maxillary diastemas prior to treatment. according to sullivan, et al. measurable relapse in patients with relatively small midline (less than 1 mm) is less common than once thought. space closure in more than two-thirds of the patients observed at least 10 years postretention was stable.","{'answer_start': [2295], 'text': ['the alveolar ridge narrowed by 25% during the first 3 years']}",,biology,"{'authors': ['David L.

"regarding chinese niti alloy orthodontic wires, what is the lattice structure of the austenite phase?","chinese niti wire possesses super-elasticity and shape memory. the possible uses of chinese niti wire are many in that it offers low-stiffness and high-springback for tooth alignment. because of its high range of action or springback, chinese niti wire is applicable in situations where large deflections are required. the wire produces a constant force and maintains a higher magnitude of force level over the range of activation. at the high temperature range, the crystal structure of niti alloy is in an austenite phase, which is a body-centered cubic lattice. at the low temperature range, the material is in the martensitic phase, a close-packed hexagonal lattice. by controlling the low and high temperature ranges, a change in crystal structure called martensitic transformation can be produced. niti alloy, a nearly equi-atomic intermetallic compound, incorporates a variety of properties that can be controlled by manufacturing technique. in the low temperature, martensitic phase niti alloy is ductile. in austenite phase in the high temperature range, it is more difficult to induce deformation.","{'answer_start': [536], 'text': ['body-centered cubic lattice']}",,materials,"{'authors': ['Rong Chen, DDS, MS', 'Yang Fen Zhi', 'Michael G.

"regarding three dimensional analysis, what is pitch?","mandibular prognathism is highly prevalent in asians and is usually accompanied by facial asymmetry. when skeletal disharmony is present, the dentition migrates not only anteroposteriorly and vertically but also transversely to achieve occlusal function. for patients with facial asymmetry, accurate diagnosis and surgical treatment planning and adequate removal of transverse dental compensations in the maxillary and mandibular arches is a requisite for successful management of facial asymmetry. traditionally, two-dimensional (2d) cephalometric radiographs, such as posteroanterior (pa) cephalograms and submentovertex radiographs, have been essential tools for evaluating facial asymmetry. in 2003, kusayama et al. showed a high correlation between skeletal asymmetry and dental compensation by analyzing pa radiographs and three-dimensional (3d) dental models. shigefuji et al. also reported greater molar axis changes in the deviated side than in the nondeviated side. previous studies revealed several characteristics of transverse dental compensations and their relationship with skeletal facial asymmetry but failed to quantify the severity of deviation due to the lack of a control group. in addition, 2d modalities face limitations caused by image magnification, distortion, and superimposition of skeletal structures. when using pa images, it is easy to overestimate or underestimate the severity of facial asymmetry. gateno et al. described significant distortion of the shape and size of the mandible in roll and yaw asymmetries. currently, diagnosis and treatment planning of facial asymmetry can be performed through quantitative measurement of 3d cone-beam computed tomography (cbct) images. mandibular asymmetry should be described three-dimensionally using three angles: pitch, roll, and yaw. pitch refers to the rotation of the object around the transverse axis, roll refers to the rotation of the object around the anteroposterior axis, and yaw refers to the rotation of the object around the vertical axis. however, there has been a lack of 3d classification of mandibular asymmetry as well as evaluations on transverse dental compensation in patients with asymmetry. the purpose of this study was to evaluate the characteristic transverse dental compensations in patients with facial asymmetry and mandibular prognathism and to compare features of dental compensations between two types of mandibular asymmetry using 3d cbct.","{'answer_start': [1829], 'text': ['the rotation of the object around the transverse axis']}",,anatomy,"{'authors': ['Svetlana Tyan *', 'Hong-Sik Park *', 'Munkhshur Janchivdorj', 'Sun-Ho Han', 'Su-Jung Kim', 'Hyo-Won Ahn'], 'doi': 'https://doi.org/10.2319/030915-142.1', 'meta': 'Angle Orthod (2016) 86 (3): 421–430.', 'title': 'Three-dimensional analysis of molar compensation in patients with facial asymmetry and mandibular prognathism'}",a34679b8-10cc-405d-9f98-686ccca88192
"regarding mandibular expansion with the lip bumper, what percentage of expansion is achieved during the first 300 days?","a critical aspect of nonextraction therapy is the creation of space. the results from this study show that lip bumper therapy is an effective means of accomplishing this task. other studies have demonstrated similar results using lip bumpers but have not focused on the attenuation in expansion that occurs during treatment. a major concern for orthodontists is treatment effectiveness and efficiency. it would be beneficial to know the specific amount of time required to achieve sufficient expansion using lip bumper therapy. this information would benefit the clinician by eliminating unnecessary lip bumper wear. this would obviously be desirable for the patients as well. the expansion achieved during lip bumper therapy is evenly distributed during treatment. however, the results clearly demonstrate that the expansion occurred unevenly and actually decreased with time. table 4 shows that for each of the measurements, the greatest amount of expansion, about 50% of the total, occurred within about the first 100 days. during the second and third time periods, about 40% of the total amount of expansion will have occurred. during the last two time segments, the percentage of total expansion achieved is only about 10%. therefore, about 90% of the expansion was completed in these cases within the first 300 days, and treatment effectiveness after this point yielded only about 10% of the total expansion.","{'answer_start': [1240], 'text': ['about 90% of the expansion']}",,clinical,"{'authors': ['C.

"in serial extractions, when should the primary molar be removed?","for optimum results in serial extraction a deciduous tooth should be removed at a time when the permanent successor will emerge without delay. it has been shown in the present study that extraction of a deciduous molar at any age causes a brief spurt in premolar eruption, but the timing of clinical emergence is not necessarily affected. in fact, early extraction may result in delayed eruption and emergence. correctly planned extraction at a later period will result in accelerated emergence. the timing of extraction should be based on the developmental stage of the tooth and should coincide with its phase of active eruption. it has been shown by gron that premolars emerge when one-half to three-fourths of their roots are formed but canines have slightly more root formation at emergence. therefore, a deciduous tooth should not be removed until its permanent successor has an appropriate amount of root formation or at least one-fourth to one-half of the root length. it is also necessary to consider the ages at which the root stages mentioned are reached, as well as the duration, or interval, between these stages. from longitudinal data of dental development the mean age and standard deviation of attaining the one-fourth, one-half and three-fourth stages of root development in males and females for the canine, first premolar and second premolar are presented in table ii. the average duration of these stages is shown in table iii for the canine and premolars of males and females. this mean interval between the attainment of one-fourth and one-half root stages varies from 1.29 years in the second premolar to 2.32 years in the canine. the duration between the stages of one-half and three-fourths is less, varying from 1,05 to 1.59 years. it is emphasized that the time needed for root formation prior to emergence is longer than generally expected. however, the interval between the stages root three-fourths formed to root with open apex, associated with emergence of the teeth, is shorter, ranging from 0.51 years to 0.86 years.","{'answer_start': [77], 'text': ['at a time when the permanent successor will emerge without delay']}",,growth,"{'authors': ['Elizabeth A.

what is the composition of beta-phase titanium (tma) alloys?,"the last major alloy system to have an impact on current clinical orthodontics was introduced around 1980. stabilized beta-phase titanium alloys contain about 80% titanium. in addition, they include 11.5% molybdenum, 6% zirconium, and 4.5% tin. historically, pure titanium has a stiffness (102 gpa) that is about one-half that of stainless steel; the stiffness subsequently varies from 99 to 127 gpa upon alloying to form the conventional type of alpha-phase titanium alloys. for orthodontic use, one of dr. burstones primary objectives was to produce an alloy whose deactivation characteristics were about one-third that of stainless steel or twice that of a conventional martensitic stabilized nitinol. this led to ormco corporations introduction of the low-stiffness beta-phase titanium-molybdenum alloy known as tma. advantages of this alloy were several. when compared with nitinol, tma was inherently smoother (figure 6), could be welded, and had good formability. moreover, when compared with stainless steels, tma produced gentler linear forces per unit of deactivation and had substantially more range and higher springback. indeed, tma was almost the perfect wire, since its characteristics were so balanced. yet tma, too, had a latent flaw the coefficients of friction were the worst of any of the orthodontic alloys, and consequently its ability to accommodate the sliding of teeth was limited (figure 7). ironically, the first alloy to be used during this modern era of orthodontics, stainless steel, remains the best in this regard.","{'answer_start': [159], 'text': ['80% titanium. in addition, they include 11.5% molybdenum, 6% zirconium, and 4.5% tin']}",,materials,"{'authors': ['Robert P.

"if a force is applied on a tooth away from the center of resistance, what will be the resulting tooth movement?","in the analysis of a 2x4 appliance force system, the incisor teeth are best considered as one unit with one center of resistance. if a wire inserts passively into the molar tube of a 2x4 appliance, no couple is present, and no tendency to rotate due to the moment of a couple is present. however, if a wire is inserted into the molar tube and actively deformed when tied to, but not inserted in, the brackets of the incisor unit of teeth, a couple is created at the molar tube, but no couple is created at the incisor point attachment (figure 2a). when the rectangular wire of a 2x4 appliance is deformed for insertion into both the molar and brackets, couples are created at both brackets and the moments of the couples and resulting equilibrium forces at both attachments obey established laws of mechanics. the essence of activating a 2x4 appliance is the creation and control of moments and their equilibrium forces. moments are created by only two mechanisms i) a single force acting away from the center of resistance or, ii) a pair of forces or couple. the moment of a single force results from a point force acting on a tooth away from the center of resistance, causing the tooth to rotate around a center of rotation which is apical to the center of resistance. the moment of a couple results from a couple at the bracket (figure 1) and causes rotation around the center of resistance of the tooth. any single force, including a net equilibrium force resulting from a moment, causes translation of the tooth if applied through the center of resistance of the tooth. since it is rarely possible to apply forces through the center of resistance, forces usually create a moment of the force. this kind of moment is measured by the magnitude of the force times the perpendicular distance from the line of the force to the center of resistance. the moment of the force is varied simply by altering the point of application of the force and is not an inherent property of the equilibrium of a given system as is the moment of the couple. the moment of a couple at any bracket 1s potentially derived from several components. when a wire is not yet inserted into the brackets and is positioned over two equal sized adjacent brackets, the greater the angle of entry of the wire into the bracket, the greater the moment of the couple at that bracket. this angle of entry is affected by preactivation bends in the wire and/or the position of result of tooth malposition or bracket bonding error. since this component of the moment of the couple is determined by the passive wire/bracket slot angulation before the deformation of the wire that results from its placement in the bracket slot, this is termed the passive component of the moment of the couple. in addition, when a wire of any given stiffness is inserted into a bracket slot, deformation of the wire occurs which also contributes to the moment of the couple. this component of the moment of the couple, resulting from deformation of the wire itself, is termed the active component of the moment of the couple. the active component of the moment of a couple naturally decreases as tooth movement occurs with progressive deactivation of the wire.","{'answer_start': [1191], 'text': ['rotate around a center of rotation which is apical to the center of resistance']}",,biomechanics,"{'authors': ['Robert J.

"regarding the properties alloys used in orthodontics, what are the advantages of beta titanium (tma) compared to stainless steel?","the last major alloy system to have an impact on current clinical orthodontics was introduced around 1980. stabilized beta-phase titanium alloys contain about 80% titanium. in addition, they include 11.5% molybdenum, 6% zirconium, and 4.5% tin. historically, pure titanium has a stiffness (102 gpa) that is about one-half that of stainless steel; the stiffness subsequently varies from 99 to 127 gpa upon alloying to form the conventional type of alpha-phase titanium alloys. for orthodontic use, one of dr. burstones primary objectives was to produce an alloy whose deactivation characteristics were about one-third that of stainless steel or twice that of a conventional martensitic stabilized nitinol. this led to ormco corporations introduction of the low-stiffness beta-phase titanium-molybdenum alloy known as tma. advantages of this alloy were several. when compared with nitinol, tma was inherently smoother (figure 6), could be welded, and had good formability. moreover, when compared with stainless steels, tma produced gentler linear forces per unit of deactivation and had substantially more range and higher springback. indeed, tma was almost the perfect wire, since its characteristics were so balanced. yet tma, too, had a latent flaw the coefficients of friction were the worst of any of the orthodontic alloys, and consequently its ability to accommodate the sliding of teeth was limited (figure 7). ironically, the first alloy to be used during this modern era of orthodontics, stainless steel, remains the best in this regard.","{'answer_start': [1031], 'text': ['gentler linear forces per unit of deactivation and had substantially more range and higher springback']}",,materials,"{'authors': ['Robert P.

"in non-growing patients who received rapid palatal expansion in the absence of surgery, how did clinical crown length at the premolar and molar change compared to patients who were expanded with surgery?","we become more likely to advocate surgery as the age, transverse needs, or acceptance of the idea of surgery increases. when there is greater need for increased lingual volume, especially at the palatal apex, the surgeon might be encouraged to provide a bilateral separation on either side of the palatal suture, as well as the buccal corticotomy. too many patients in their late teens have spent sleepless nights, without sufficient pain killers to provide comfort, waiting to see if the palatal suture is going to release. all things being equal, we much prefer the surgical alternative; and we dont feel that we compromise the peridontium as much as unassisted, orthopedic expansion does. 1. maxillary expansion in adults, both orthopedic as advocated by haas and surgically assisted, is predictable and stable; typical expansion is 3.5 mm at the maxillary canines and 5.5 mm at the molars. corrected crossbites remain corrected. 2. depth of the palate is reduced during treatment in both surgical groups. 3. palatal width increases significantly, especially when buccal corticotomies are accompanied by a palatal split. 4. palatal expansion, followed by a full course of edgewise orthodontic treatment, results in very controlled, beneficial tipping. 5. clinical crown length increased more in the premolars and molars in nongrowing patients who were expanded in the absence surgery.","{'answer_start': [1258], 'text': ['clinical crown length increased more in the premolars and molars']}",,clinical,"{'authors': ['William M.

when does the involution of adenoids usually occur?,"in subject 64 (fig. 13) the ad area percentage at age 18 is 26.3 percent. examination of the lateral cephalometric radiograph at this age demonstrates a smooth concave contour to the posterior pharyngeal wall, and the assumption is made that the adenoid has undergone involution. if one further assumes that for this individual the pharyngeal wall area is 26 percent of the np area from infancy to maturity, an approximation of percentage of true adenoid tissue becomes that part of the ad area greater than 26 percent. the percentage of the pharyngeal wall varies greatly among individuals and may be equated to the ad area on the last cephalometric film provided the pharyngeal wall has a smooth concave contour. at age 17 years nine months the ad area, which is presumably mostly pharyngeal wall area, was 35.6 + 8.2 percent for males and 39.9 + 11.3 percent for females. the explanation of figures 13 and 14 is based on the preceding assumptions. subject 123 showed two periods of adenoid hypertrophy at age four and eight. involution was largely completed at age 13 (fig. 14). subject 12 showed adenoid hypertrophy until age seven which severely restricted the nasopharyngeal airway. t and a at age seven dramatically reduced the adenoid tissue and the ad area is similar from age seven through 18 (fig. 14). subjects 64 and 11 showed adenoid hypertrophy at a maximum between age three to ten. involution was largely completed after 13 years. t and a performed on both subjects during the period of hypertrophy had no apparent effect on adenoid size. the following generalization is based on the ad area percentage type analysis used in figures 13 and 14: most subjects demonstrated minimal adenoid at one year, adenoid hypertrophy evident by two years, a maximum of adenoid tissue during the early school years, and adenoid involution during adolescence. the involution of the adenoids judged by the contour of the pharyngeal wall on x-rays varied in the twelve subjects studied, some showing involution prior to adolescence, and others showing moderate amounts of adenoid tissue present at 18 years. the size of the nasopharynx and its component areas, the airway, soft tissue pharyngeal wall and the adenoids, has been quantified using lateral cephalometric radiographs. the nasopharynx, for purposes of analysis in this paper, is a trapezoid formed by four planes which represent the skeletal limits of this region. bergland used a triangle based on three anatomic points, pterygomaxillare, hormion and basion, to describe the bony nasopharynx. linderadapted berglands analysis of the nasopharynx and measured the adenoids within the triangle using a planimeter.","{'answer_start': [1841], 'text': ['during adolescence']}",,growth,"{'authors': ['CHESTER S.

"during active treatment with rapid maxillary expansion and fixed appliances, what is the gain in maxillary arch perimeter?","in the short term, after rme and fixed appliance therapy, the tg presented with significant changes in all arch dimensions when compared with normal controls (table 2). both maxillary and mandibular arch widths and depths showed significant increases in the treated sample. during active treatment, the maxillary arch width at both intermolar and intercanine measures demonstrated an average increment of about four mm, whereas the increases in mandibular arch widths range between one and two mm. with regard to the gain in arch perimeters, 6.5 mm of increase in the maxillary arch was associated with four mm of increase in the mandibular arch. during the posttreatment period, very slight changes occurred in the arch width measurements both in the maxilla and mandible of the treated subjects (table 2). on the contrary, a rather substantial tendency to relapse occurred in the arch perimeters ( 3.5 mm in the maxillary arch and 2.5 mm in the mandibular arch) after active treatment. in the overall observation period, the increase for maxillary intermolar width was 4.5 mm and one mm for mandibular intermolar width. the increase in maxillary arch perimeter was three mm, whereas the increase in mandibular arch perimeter was 1.5 mm. these increments may appear limited in amount and clinical significance. however, the findings need to be interpreted by taking into consideration the actual changes that occur in a sample of untreated subjects in the long term. in a time period of about eight years that covers approximately the late mixed and early permanent dentitions, an average decrease of three mm is observed in untreated subjects in both maxillary and mandibular arch perimeters. the results of the present study confirm previous data by brust and mcnamara10 in this regard.","{'answer_start': [542], 'text': ['6.5 mm of increase in the maxillary arch']}",,clinical,"{'authors': ['James A.

"regarding cephalometric analysis, what is the nasolabial angle?","rudee measured linear changes in incisor position and soft tissue (upper lip protrusion) as a perpendicular measurement from the facial plane. his study suggested a 1:2 (mode), or 1:3 (mean) ratio of upper lip retraction to maxillary incisor retraction. garner found a ratio of 1:2 in black females, noting that the ratio is closer to 1:3.6 in black males. harris found a ratio of upper lip to incisor retraction of 2:3 with maxillary osteotomy. this larger response is very possibly due to the retraction of skeletal and other structures not retracted with orthodontic tooth movement alone. hershey stated that have been unable to isolate the effects of treatment on profile change because of the superimposed growth of the structure under investigation. he studied incisor retraction in 36 adult females and still found an unpredictable effect on the lip. his studies also suggested that lip morphology (incompetent vs. redundant) has little effect on the soft tissue response to dental movement. burstone feels that lip protrusion in class ii, division 1 malocclusion is the result of the combined effects of axial inclination of upper incisors, the adaptation of the upper lip to the incisor, and the thickness of soft tissue. respiratory mouth breathing) and other influences on lip posture are other factors. one popular measurement of protrusion relative to the inferior border of the nose is the nasolabial angle. this is the angle formed by the intersection of a line tangent to the mean lower border of the nose and a line from subnasale to labiale superiorus. it averages 112 in patients with normal profiles. the purpose of this study is to document postural changes that have occurred in the upper lip with retraction of maxillary incisors in class ii, division 1 malocclusions.","{'answer_start': [1430], 'text': ['the angle formed by the intersection of a line tangent to the mean lower border of the nose and a line from subnasale to labiale superiorus']}",,anatomy,"{'authors': ['BENJAMIN H.

"for growing class ii patients, which functional appliance showed significant opening of the gonial angle?","the bionator group showed significant opening of the gonial angle (ar-go-me) after functional treatment. this 2.0 per year increase in the gonial angle was greater than any of the untreated and treated samples and is most likely attributed to the growth direction of the condyle and remodeling of the posterior border of the ramus. the significant reduction in the overbite in the bionator group is to be anticipated, as the mandible migrates forward along the lingual inclines of the maxillary incisors. the greatest amount of lingual crown tipping of the maxillary incisors was shown in this treatment group and could be attributed to pressure from the labial bow. this finding has been reported by other investigators. the herbst group had a significant decrease of the wits over time, possibly due to maxillary growth restriction and change in the occlusal plane. pancherz et al and berger et al reported similar findings with forward and downward movement of pogonion (0.8 per year) and opening of the mandibular plane angle. the decrease in overbite and overjet was consistently significant at the end of treatment and parallels the findings of the previous studies. although the herbst appliance is a tooth-borne appliance, there were no adverse effects on the dentition. this can be directly associated with the full acrylic coverage splint design of the appliance used in this study. the twin block, herbst, and mara patients showed an increase in mandibular length of 1.5 mm per year, 1.2 mm per year, and 0.94 mm per year, respectively. similar trends were noted by baccetti et al, wieslander et al, and berger et al for these appliances. it has been suggested that the most effective timing for treatment with the bionator, twin block, and herbst appliances is during or slightly after the onset of the pubertal peak in growth velocity. the mean age of the patients in this study at the start of functional appliance treatment was 10 years 7 months for the bionator group and 10 years 11 months for the twin block group. the herbst and mara groups began 1 2 years thereafter. this difference in chronologic age could not be explain the larger increments of growth experienced with the twin block, herbst and mara, since all of the patients were matched by their growth maturation status. the greatest change in mandibular length occurred during functional appliance treatment when compared with the controls. after this initial growth surge, only the mara patients sustained a longer mandibular growth length of 1.0 mm per year when compared with the controls. this finding is in agreement with that reported by livieratos and johnston who suggested that functional appliances place a mortgage on mandibular growth. control clinical trials also found no significant alteration of mandibular length long term with the utilization of functional appliances.","{'answer_start': [0], 'text': ['the bionator']}",,clinical,"{'authors': ['Nicole J.

"in orthopedic correction of class iii, what can be said of aggressive overcorrection at a skeletal level?","three studies included a cephalometric observation about 3 years from the end of active orthopedic treatment: two of these reported a lack of significant differences between treated and control groups, suggesting that the favorable treatment effects on the maxillomandibular relationship were maintained. however, the treatment effect of increased overjet was diminished, mainly due to proclination of the mandibular incisors. successfully treated cases demonstrated a significantly greater change in overjet during treatment, suggesting that some overcorrection may be necessary for maintenance of a successful correction. one study reported no statistically significant skeletal or soft-tissue differences between the groups at the end of posttreatment observation, except for the increased overjet and overbite in the chincap subjects. two articles evaluated the posttreatment effects of an initial phase of orthopedic treatment followed by comprehensive edgewise therapy, with a follow-up observation at about 5 years from the end of orthopedic treatment. favorable skeletal change observed post treatment was due almost entirely to the orthopedic correction: during the posttreatment period, craniofacial growth in treated subjects was similar to that of untreated class iii controls. thus, aggressive overcorrection at a skeletal level appears to be advisable and essential to the stability of the treatment outcome. research quality was low in four studies, medium in 10 studies, and medium/high in five. the selection description was adequate in all studies. withdrawals (dropouts) were declared only in the rct study, and in this study the number of dropouts was three. nine articles used proper statistical methods; in the remaining studies the choice of a parametric test without data distribution analysis was inadequate. thirteen studies included a method error analysis, and only one article used blinding in measurements. no study declared the presence of ethical approval with regard to the employment of an untreated control group with a class iii malocclusion. no article declared a previous estimate of sample size.","{'answer_start': [1296], 'text': ['aggressive overcorrection at a skeletal level appears to be advisable and essential to the stability of the treatment']}",,clinical,"{'authors': ['Laura De Toffol', 'Chiara Pavoni', 'Tiziano Baccetti', 'Lorenzo Franchi', 'Paola Cozza'], 'doi': 'https://doi.org/10.2319/030207-108.1', 'meta': 'Angle Orthod (2008) 78 (3): 561–573.', 'title': 'Orthopedic Treatment Outcomes in Class III Malocclusion: A Systematic Review'}",249bd5db-c9a8-4c55-b370-01bef65d659f

are impacted upper canines more common in males or females?,"maxillary impacted canines are more common in females than males. according to ericson and kurol, the sex ratio between male and female is 2:3. in the current study, there were more female subjects (58%) than male subjects (42%), resulting in a ratio of almost 1.37:1. walker et al. speculated that the difference in growth and development between the sexes, as well as genetics, may be reasons for the above finding. another possible reason could be that females seek orthodontic treatment more frequently than males. lindauer et al. reported that most canines destined to become palatally impacted had cusp tips overlapping or mesial to the lateral incisor root. in the <15 year group of the current study, sector 1 showed more frequent labially impacted canines. sectors 2, 3, 4, and 5 showed more frequent palatally impacted canines. in the >15 year group, the sample size in each category of sector 1 was too small to see a pattern. sectors 3, 4, and 5 showed more frequent palatally impacted canines, and sector 2 showed the most frequent labially impacted canines. in addition, among five sectors, mid-alveolus positioned canines were found most commonly in sector 2. in total, most labially impacted canines were located in sector 1, mid-alveolus impacted canines were more frequent in sector 2, and palatally impacted canines were positioned mainly in sectors 3, 4, and 5. this suggests that sector location on panoramic radiographs could be used to predict the labio-palatal position of impacted canines.","{'answer_start': [10], 'text': ['impacted canines are more common in females']}",,clinical,"{'authors': ['Cuc Thi Thu Ngo', 'Leonard S.

"with regards to bonding strength between bracket and tooth surface, how does the self-etch systems compare to conventional systems?","in the process of bonding orthodontic brackets to enamel, most conventional adhesive systems use three different agents: an enamel conditioner, a primer solution, and an adhesive resin. acid conditioning of enamel with 35 37% phosphoric acid has been the most effective method for enhancing the bonding of adhesive resin composite restorative materials to enamel. acid etching results in microporosities in the enamel surface, into which the adhesive can penetrate to produce micromechanical retention of the restoration and increase the bondable surface area. in addition to creating microporosities, the conditioner agent removes the organic film from the tooth surface so that a more direct contact is established at the tooth restorative interface. as a result, there is a need to improve our ability to maintain clinically useful bond strength while minimizing the amount of tooth destruction, whether by fracture or by decalcification. a unique characteristic of some new bonding systems in operative dentistry is that these systems combine the conditioning and priming agents into a single acidic primer solution for simultaneous use on both enamel and dentin. current data suggest that the new self-etch adhesive systems have comparable bond strength with those of conventional systems, resulting in a strong and predictable bond to the tooth surface. therefore, the introduction of these new tooth preparation technologies, along with the development of new simplified one-step self-etching adhesive systems, may result in more efficient and conservative ways of achieving predictable bonding to tooth structure.","{'answer_start': [1194], 'text': ['the new self-etch adhesive systems have comparable bond strength with those of conventional systems']}",,materials,"{'authors': ['Raed Ajlouni, BDS, MS', 'Samir E.

what is the relationship between occlusal interference and occlusal trauma?,"the need for a multidisciplinary approach. rehabilitation of detentions with advanced periodontal disease is a complicated treatment procedure which requires skills in several disciplines of dentistry. the functional, esthetic and posttreatment stability demands of each case dictate the need for a team approach including periodontist, orthodontist and prosthodontist. there must be an agreed upon treatment plan by all disciplines involved with treatment and limitations clearly understood. during the orthodontic phase of treatment this cooperation is called into play for the identification and elimination of two major detrimental factors, inflammation and trauma. in the presence of inflammation, orthodontic tooth movement will not bring about positive changes in the periodontium. in fact, several clinicians have shown that in the presence of inflammatory periodontal disease, tooth movement may actually cause a deepening of osseous defects. it is clear that routine periodontal treatment and good oral hygiene to prevent inflammation are absolute necessities during orthodontic procedures. many clinicians believe that occlusal trauma has a catalytic effect upon the progression of periodontal disease, therefore occlusal adjustment by selective grinding is most important before and during orthodontic movement to eliminate occlusal interferences. these interferences are the causative factor of occlusal trauma. the histologic, radiographic and clinical manifestations of occlusal trauma have been documented long ago. in the formulation of a treatment plan for patients with advanced periodontal disease, we must consider the benefits that orthodontics can supply. by improving the position of malposed teeth, we create a better environment for the health of the gingivae and attachment apparatus, as well as the possibility of improving osseous defects as the result of orthodontically stimulated osteogenic activity.","{'answer_start': [1366], 'text': ['interferences are the causative factor of occlusal trauma']}",,clinical,"{'authors': ['E.

"regarding treatment approaches for class ii malocclusion, what is early treatment?","there are two general strategies prevailing today for the timing of treatment for class ii malocclusion. the first calls for intervention during the pre-adolescent years (ages 8-11) with limited goals that include correction of the molar distocclusion, improvement of the overjet/overbite relationships and incisor alignment. this so-called early treatment is usually followed by a more definitive intervention during adolescence (ages 12-15) designed to finish and detail the occlusion. the second major approach to the timing of class ii treatment is to accomplish the entire correction during the adolescent years. early treatment as described here should not be confused with either interceptive or preventive treatment. these latter approaches usually involve fairly limited appliance interventions which successfully produce a satisfactory result without further treatment at adolescence. in contrast, early treatment of a class ii malocclusion is defined as a first phase of a comprehensive treatment, begun prior to adolescence and designed to achieve class ii correction with a second phase required for the completion of treatment. two lines of thought suggest that commencing orthodontic and/or orthopedic class ii correction in the pre-adolescent period is more effective than delaying it until later. first, the tissues of the craniofacial complex may be more adaptive at a younger age. second, pre-adolescent patients may be more compliant than teenagers. animal studies using both functional jaw orthopedics and extra oral forces? have clearly shown that significant craniofacial modification can be effected in both adult and young animals. however, the magnitude and rate with which these changes were achieved were greater in the younger animals. several possible mechanisms for this have been suggested: the bones are less mineralized and therefore more easily deformed, sutures and ligaments are more cellular resulting in more rapid biological responses, and growing tissues are generally more responsive to external forces. clinicians have made the empirical observation that the best orthopedic results are obtained when growth is most active and that the juvenile period has greater growth on the average at its beginning. although there is much to be learned about the adaptive process, the mechanisms at play during various developmental stages and the role played by growth in these responses, pragmatic considerations have led advocates of both functional jaw orthopedics and headgear therapy to conclude that class ii correction can most readily be achieved in the early mixed dentition.","{'answer_start': [965], 'text': ['a first phase of a comprehensive treatment, begun prior to adolescence and designed to achieve class ii correction with a second phase required for the completion of treatment']}",,clinical,"{'authors': ['Gregory J.

"regarding the bonding of orthodontic brackets, what happens to the enamel after etching with phosphoric acid?","scanning electron microscopy (sem) has been the traditional method used to study the overall microscopic surface structure of dental tissues; however, it is not a surface-specific technique. a significant difficulty associated with the use of sem in examining etched enamel is the lack of consensus on grading systems. recent studies using the bet gas adsorption method support the suggestion that enamel porosity, surface area, and pore size are more important toward an understanding of enamel topography than is a defined etch pattern. gas adsorption has been studied theoretically for most of the 21st century, and the simplest of the resulting theories has provided the insight needed for most applications. still, the number of studies on dental enamel that used the gas absorption method is limited. we sought to expand on the knowledge of enamel topography by using this same method in our studies to compare how enamel properties are altered by acid-etching procedures. when phosphoric acid is applied to the dental enamel surface, it dissolves the outer smear layer, which is approximately 5 to 10 microns in thickness. the outer 5 to 50 micron ends of the enamel prisms are selectively dissolved as well. as a result, microscopic pores and enamel crystallites are exposed, resulting in a retentive surface for the primer.1 it is assumed that this increase in the number of pores and in surface irregularities results in a larger exposed area of enamel, which creates a greater area for bonding and higher subsequent bond strengths. eventually, too much acid exposure will cause the enamel crystallites to be gradually dissolved and broken down until the structure of enamel is destroyed. it is assumed that the once-opened enamel pores will slowly become obliterated by collapsing enamel structures. figures 3a and 3b illustrate the changes in surface area and pore volume that were observed after variable etch times. when all three time points are compared, a clear increase in surface area and pore volume was evident after etching. this increased etch time may have contributed to an increased number of exposed pores and, thus, to increased surface area and pore volume through the dissolving action of phosphoric acid. after 60 seconds of etching, however, both surface area and pore volume were much lower than for the other time points. this finding may be due to the aforementioned collapse of structures and the obliteration of some pores, leading to an overall decrease in both surface area and pore volume that can be detected by the bet gas adsorption method.","{'answer_start': [1130], 'text': ['the outer 5 to 50 micron ends of the enamel prisms are selectively dissolved']}",,materials,"{'authors': ['Trang T.

"regarding biomechanics of tooth movement, which factors will affect the center of resistance of a tooth?","upon the amount of eruption they had completed and movement of the first molar. the crown and apices of the second molar responded directly to the movement of the contours of the first molar. if the second molar was erupting, its crown moved occlusally following a path of least resistance. if the crown of the first molar moved distally, it forced the second molar distally whether erupted or not. the third molar was also affected similarly. it moved distally as the second molar moved into it. the tuberosity area increased to accommodate the distal movement of the third molar. in three instances of twenty hour headgear wear there was an indication of increases at the posterior border of the maxilla. however, no changes were ever observed in basilar areas. correction of class ii molars to class i relationships occurred by anterior growth displacement of the mandible, by distal movement of the maxillary molar, or a combination of both. erupted second molars in contact with first molars created a resistance to distal movement. this, in effect, altered the position of the center of resistance of the first molar. in patients with fully erupted second molars it was noted that the headgear force vector that caused translation was closer to the crown rather than at the trifurcation. when a force is applied to a body, the body resists the force (newtons third law of motion). if it is a free body this resistance to movement can be reduced to one point called the center of resistance. a force directed through the center of resistance will translate the body (fig. 3). a tooth resists movement in a similar manner (fig. 4). resistance to movement comes from the periodontal membrane, the alveolus and adjacent contacting dental units, as well as the tooth itself. as force is applied to this system, the are brought to bear. if all the separate resistances are analyzed, they could be reduced to one point of resistance through which a force could be directed to cause translation. this point of resistance in the dental system that promotes translation is called the center of resistance. a dental system because of its biological nature will vary. as these variations of the periodontal membrane, alveolus and adjacent dental units occur, so will the center of resistance vary. in everyday clinical orthodontics the orthodontist is adjusting his force delivery systems relative to centers of resistance. when translation of the dental unit occurs, his force has been directed through the center of resistance.","{'answer_start': [2171], 'text': ['variations of the periodontal membrane, alveolus and adjacent dental units occur']}",,biomechanics,"{'authors': ['FRANK W.

"in subjects with class ii division 2 malocclusion, how are the maxillary central incisors positioned generally?","class ii division 2 malocclusion is characterized by the permanent mandibular incisors occluding posterior to the cingulum plateau of retroclined permanent maxillary incisors. this gives rise to a reduced overjet and frequently an increased overbite. classically, the permanent maxillary central incisors are retroclined and the maxillary lateral incisors are proclined and mesiolabially rotated. however, all four permanent maxillary incisors may be retroclined with or without facially displaced and proclined permanent maxillary canines. the relationship of the labial soft tissues to the permanent maxillary incisors has been implicated as the principal etiological factor in the development and relapse of class ii division 2 malocclusion. specifically, the maxillary incisor retroclination is thought to result from increased resting lip pressure as a consequence of a combination of hyperactivity of the labial musculature and a higher resting lip line. despite cephalometric studies confirming the higher resting lip line, electromyographic studies have not confirmed unanimously increased labial musculature activity in subjects with class ii division 2 malocclusions when compared with those with class i malocclusion. furthermore, no previous study has investigated simultaneously lip shape and position as a factor in the development of class ii division 2 malocclusion. this is because shape data cannot be derived from linear and angular measurements. morphometric techniques overcome many of the limitations of conventional cephalometric measurements because they integrate geometric location and biologic homology allowing shape comparisons to be made. the objective of this study is to determine whether differences exist in the shape and position of the lips between class ii division 2 and class i malocclusions. the null hypothesis tested is that there are no differences in the shape and position of the lips between class ii division 2 and class 1 malocclusions.","{'answer_start': [264], 'text': ['the permanent maxillary central incisors are retroclined']}",,clinical,"{'authors': ['Grant T.

"regarding craniofacial growth in the adolescent, what is the average rate of forward rotation of the mandible during the 6 years surrounding pubertal growth spurt?","the mandible typically rotates in a forward direction, with greater rates of true rotation noted during childhood than during adolescence (table 1). skieller et al reported an average change of 1.0 degree/y during the 6 years surrounding the pubertal growth spurt. odegaard showed that the mandible rotates forward 0.8 degree/y in subjects 7 to 14 years of age; lavergne and gasson reported 0.9 degree/y forward rotation between 7 and 19 years of age. based on longitudinal data, spady et al reported 0.9 degree/y of true forward rotation per year between 6 and 11 years and 0.4 degree/y between 11 and 15 years of age. miller and kerr also reported higher rates of true rotation during childhood (1.3 degrees/y) than during adolescence (0.4 degree/y). karlsen showed similar rates of true forward mandibular rotation (1.3 degree/y) during childhood (6 to 12 y) and adolescence (12 to 15 y), perhaps related to the age spans of the samples. to date, no study has been specifically designed to evaluate the true rotation and remodeling that occur during the transition from late primary to early mixed dentitions. on the basis of limited data, spady and coworkers have suggested that greater rates of true rotation occur during the transition from late primary to early mixed dentition than during later childhood or adolescence. the relatively high rates of true rotation reported by miller and kerr for children 5 to 10 years of age might have been, at least partially, associated with dental changes that occurred. unfortunately, neither study selected samples on the basis of dental development. given the potentially important growth and remodeling implications, the primary purpose of this study was to describe true mandibular rotation and remodeling during the transition from late primary to early mixed dentition. to determine relative magnitudes, these early changes will be compared with later rotational changes.","{'answer_start': [194], 'text': ['1.0 degree/y']}",,growth,"{'authors': ['Malanie K.

"regarding the treatment of patients with temporomandibular disorders (tmd), how does the combination of education and home physical therapy compare to only education?","a variety of specific therapies are available for treating patients with temporomandibular disorders (tmds). one type of tmd is myofascial pain, which usually is caused by overactivity of the muscles of mastication. although dentists attempt to educate patients about the etiology of myofascial pain, knowledge alone, without home therapy, may be inadequate to gain relief of pain. a study published in the journal of orofacial pain (2004;18:114 125) evaluated the additional benefit of home physical therapy to relieve myofascial pain. the sample consisted of 70 consecutive patients who appeared for therapy at a teaching clinic that specialized in treating patients for tmd. each of these individuals had myofascial pain that had been recurrent or constant for the previous three months, and the spontaneous pain in the last week was greater than 30 on a 100-mm visual analog scale. these patients were randomly assigned to either one of two treatment groups. in one group, the patients were reassured by the dentist, who explained the problem, the suspected etiology, and the good prognosis of this benign disorder. the patients were told to avoid excess mandibular movement, to keep their teeth apart at times of more severe pain, and to keep a soft diet. in the second group, the same education was provided, but the patients were also asked to follow a routine protocol, which included self-relaxation exercises with diaphragmatic breathing, self-massage of the masticatory muscles, application of moist heat pads on the painful muscles, stretching, and coordination exercises. when the samples were compared after three months, the success rate of significant relief of pain was 57% for the education only group, and 77% for the group that received both education and home physical therapy. based upon the data from this study, the authors conclude that the combination of education and home physical therapy is slightly more clinically effective than education alone for the treatment of myofascial pain of the jaw muscles.","{'answer_start': [1862], 'text': ['the combination of education and home physical therapy is slightly more clinically effective than education alone']}",,none,"{'authors': ['Vincent Kokich, DDS, MSD'], 'doi': 'https://doi.org/10.1043/0003-3219(2004)074<0723:WNID>2.0.CO;2', 'meta': 'Angle Orthod (2004) 74 (6): 723–724.', 'title': ""What's New in Dentistry""}",549697e7-55f3-4376-968f-9407bfa3f65e
"regarding nickel-titanium (niti) alloy properties, what is the difference in the stress/strain properties of wires that exist only in the austenitic phase compared to wires where multiple phases coexist?","the temperatures chosen for our tests are in agreement with those used in the study of moore et al., who reported during the 24-hour period a temperature range from 5.6c to 58.5c at the incisor site and from 7.9c to 54c at the premolar site. if the force expressed by niti wires increases with the increase in temperature, the force will decrease with the drop in temperature, as observed in our study; in particular, we reported a decrease, on average, of 82% for the heat-activated wires and a decrease of 77% for the traditional wires. this confirms the behavior described by tonner and waters, who demonstrated that at high temperatures, when the niti wires exist solely in the austenitic phase, a greater stress is required to produce strain than when other phases coexist, such as the martensite and transition phases at lower temperatures. moreover, our tests showed, both at 55c and at 5c, an average increase in plateau force with increasing diameter of archwires. the force expressed by traditional archwires shows a slightly greater tendency to increase with increasing diameter with respect to heat-activated wires. the niti wires, both traditional and heat-activated, showed a permanent strain at the temperature of 55c. according to miyazaki et al., this can occur when the stress required to induce sim is greater than that required to cause plastic strain. residual deflection, however, is very important to the clinician. a permanently deflected archwire below a certain value of deflection (specific for each niti wire) doesn't work anymore and has to be substituted by a new one in order to complete the alignment. instead, the residual deflection noted at 5c was recoverable, increasing the temperature and for this reason does not have a clinical importance.","{'answer_start': [702], 'text': ['greater stress is required to produce strain']}",,materials,"{'authors': ['Luca Lombardo', 'Giorgia Toni', 'Filippo Stefanoni', 'Francesco Mollica', 'Maria Paola Guarneri', 'Giuseppe Siciliani'], 'doi': 'https://doi.org/10.2319/040612-287.1', 'meta': 'Angle Orthod (2013) 83 (2): 298–305.', 'title': 'The effect of temperature on the mechanical behavior of nickel-titanium orthodontic initial archwires'}",120dcf23-2120-4ad2-8113-de40fdcd9f59

"regarding craniofacial growth, what is the last portion of the facial complex to stop growing?","thus, it can be said that most class ii cases have had average horizontal growth. their principal shortcoming is that they have had too much vertical growth. herein lies the crux of the orthodontic problem, namely, the relation of vertical to horizontal growth. the difficulty is in the fact that the vertical component of growth limits the horizontal component. this in turn prevents the forward movement of the chin. thus, we must not think of the growth of the jaws merely as a concentric enlargement of the face, but as definite amounts of growth in millimeters occurring in specific areas resulting in specific effects on overbite and overjet. the implications in the literature are that when the mandibular plane becomes steeper as a result of treatment it subsequently returns to its original position. just how this happens is not stated but it is implied that this occurs much as a rotated tooth returns to its original position. reidel wrote, if it is noted at the completion of orthodontic treatment that the mandibular plane has increased, it can be expected to return to its former angulation or less (fig. 13). it is important that we understand the cause of this mandibular rotational change. if growth has ceased to be active the mandible will permanently remain at the steeper inclination caused by treatment. if, subsequent to treatment, the condyles grow faster than total vertical growth then the mandibular plane will flatten accordingly. not just any growth but growth at the condyles causes the mandible to return to its original inclination. fortunately for the orthodontist the mandibular condyles usually are the last portion of the facial complex to stop growing, particularly in males.","{'answer_start': [1599], 'text': ['the mandibular condyles']}",,growth,"{'authors': ['F.

"regarding the bonding of orthodontic brackets to ceramic (porcelain), how can surface roughness be increased?","when bonding orthodontic brackets to porcelain surfaces, it is necessary to change the inert characteristics of the surface to achieve clinically acceptable bond strength. this alteration is accomplished by either increasing the roughness of the porcelain surface mechanically eg, by either microetching or the use of strong etchants such as hydrofluoric acid (or both), together with a silane coupling agent. such procedures cause irreversible alteration to the glazed porcelain surface. andreasen and stieg found that fracture of the porcelain itself was experienced during both tensile and shear testing when the silane coupling agents were used to increase the bond strength of orthodontic adhesives. the majority of these fractures were found in the shear sample group. newman also reported that the strength of the bond between the resin and porcelain, attained with the use of a silane coupler, was sufficient to cause the fracture of porcelain. such an occurrence is undesirable when associated with the removal of orthodontic brackets from porcelain crowns on restored teeth. therefore, newman suggested that when debonding orthodontic brackets from a porcelain surface, a ligature cutter be applied on the mesial and distal aspects of the bracket base and then twisted gently. another approach used for bracket removal is by squeezing the mesial and distal bracket tie wings together, thus distorting the bracket. the residual composite can then be removed with a scaler or a slow speed finishing bur or both. the present findings indicated that the weakest shear bond strengths were obtained when using phosphoric acid etch alone with the composite adhesive. much stronger and consistent shear bond strength was obtained when the porcelain surface was microetched followed by the use of porc-etch and porcelain conditioner, containing hydrofluoric acid and a silane coupling agent, before bonding the brackets. the new clearfil repair self-etch primer/silane/adhesive combination had comparable mean shear bond strength (table 1). on the other hand, the frequency distribution indicated a slightly higher frequency of shear bond strength values of <4.0 mpa with clearfil repair when compared with porc-etch and porcelain conditioner, ie, having a slightly less consistent behavior (table 2).","{'answer_start': [291], 'text': ['microetching or the use of strong etchants such as hydrofluoric acid (or both), together with a silane coupling agent']}",,materials,"{'authors': ['Raed Ajlouni', 'Samir E.

"regarding maxillary impacted canines, what proportion of canines are palatally impacted?","patients with impacted maxillary canines and significant resorption of the adjacent lateral incisors present the dental team with significant treatment challenges. to address these challenges effectively, it is helpful to review the literature on the etiology and incidence of both canine impaction and root resorption, especially resorption associated with impaction. treatment of a case with bilateral maxillary canine impaction and associated lateral incisor root resorption is reported. maxillary canine impaction occurs in approximately 1% to 2% of the population. females are affected approximately twice as often as males. approximately 80% to 90% of impacted canines are palatal and 10% to 20% are labial. the maxillary canine has the longest and most tortuous path of eruption, from its site of formation lateral to the piriform fossa to its final position in the arch. endocrine deficiencies, febrile diseases, and irradiation can cause general retardations in eruption, and thus can affect canine eruption. etiologic agents that may influence canines more specifically include lack of space, early loss or prolonged retention of the primary canine, abnormal position of the tooth bud, ankylosis, cystic or neoplastic formation, root dilaceration, and the iatrogenic repositioning of the adjacent lateral incisor into the canines path of eruption. palatal impactions have been associated with the absence of roots or variations in the root size of the associated maxillary lateral incisor. a genetic origin for the palatally displaced canine has also been proposed. dental crowding is more often associated with labial impactions than with palatal impactions. root resorption has been found to occur in 80% to 100% of adults, even those who have not received orthodontic treatment. orthodontic treatment is one well-documented factor in root resorption, and resorption during treatment is more likely if the teeth already show some evidence of resorption. fortunately, the resorption that is related to orthodontic treatment almost never progresses after the orthodontic forces are discontinued.","{'answer_start': [630], 'text': ['approximately 80% to 90%']}",,pathology,"{'authors': ['W.

"regarding interventions to accelerate orthodontic tooth movement, what is the effect of low level laser therapy on orthodontic tooth movement?","in this systematic review, we analyzed nine eligible studies of five types of interventions, within which six outcomes were evaluated. among the nine included studies, kim et al. and aboul-ela et al. used mini-screws as anchorage to retract canines, while the remaining seven studies used first molars. for the seven studies, measurements of the moved distances of canines may be influenced by mesial movements of the first molars. however, in consideration of the methods for the measurements (table 4), we suggest that limpanichkul et al., fischer, kim et al., and aboul-ela et al. employed reliable methods and were not influenced by the mesial movement of first molars. low-level laser therapy. for this intervention, accumulative moved distance, periodontal health, and root resorption were evaluated, but a meta-analysis was conducted only for accumulative moved distance. the pooled mean differences between the two groups regarding accumulative moved distance were 0.32 (95% ci: 0.04, 0.68), 0.76 (95% ci: 0.14, 1.65), and 0.73 (95% ci: 0.68, 2.14) for 1 month, 2 months, and 3 months, respectively, indicating that low-level laser therapy was unable to accelerate orthodontic tooth movement. begg's test and egger's test revealed no publication bias, and the sensitivity analysis indicated the robustness of the results analyzed through meta-analysis. moreover, two studies showed consistent results that laser therapy was safe in terms of periodontal and root health. therefore, we suggest that low-level laser therapy is safe regarding periodontal and root health and that it is unable to accelerate orthodontic tooth movement. the results from two included studies showed consistent results that corticotomy can accelerate orthodontic tooth movement. moreover, both employed reliable methods to measure tooth movement (table 4) and specified and used a similar start time of force applications between two groups (table 2), which would lend more credence to their results since the rates of tooth movement into healed and recent extraction sites are significantly different. moreover, the results showed that corticotomy in conjunction with mini-screws can dramatically augment posterior anchorage, which is of prime importance since effective anchorage would greatly improve orthodontic treatment results. since corticotomy is per se a surgical intervention on alveolar bones, it may have adverse effects on periodontal tissues, which was addressed in gantes et al. but not in iino et al.28 however, in this systematic review, neither study indicated that corticotomy would damage periodontal health, except that gingival index scores increased in the experimental group in aboul-ela et al. we suggest this may be simply a response of gingiva to alveolar healing, since alveolar healing following surgery takes at least 4 months. thus, dental hygiene should be paid special attention during the healing stage after corticotomy.","{'answer_start': [1584], 'text': ['it is unable to accelerate orthodontic tooth movement']}",,clinical,"{'authors': ['Hu Long', 'Ujjwal Pyakurel', 'Yan Wang', 'Lina Liao', 'Yang Zhou', 'Wenli Lai'], 'doi': 'https://doi.org/10.2319/031512-224.1', 'meta': 'Angle Orthod (2013) 83 (1): 164–171.', 'title': 'Interventions for accelerating orthodontic tooth movement: A systematic review'}",dd85af57-89bf-4923-bf2c-47e132ab4cef
"regarding soft tissue changes related to aging, which muscles lengthen to cause an increase in intercommissural width and commissure height?","the outer intercommissural width at rest increased by 3.68 mm in males and 2.88 mm in females from 20 to 50 years of age. these observations are in agreement with those noted by desai et al., who observed a significant increase in resting intercommissural width (2.71 mm) with age. the mean values for all age groups were greater for males as compared with females; however, there were no significant gender differences within the groups except for the 20 29 years age group. outer commissural width on smiling showed that it was higher in females as compared with males of the same age group. this finding is in accordance with the study of otta on smile behavior, in which he noted that females smile more expansively than males do. the commissural height at rest gradually increased with age in both sexes. dickens et al. found an increase in commissural height by 1.3 mm in males and by 1.1 mm in females from 16 to greater than 40 years. the mean values for all age groups were greater for males as compared with females; however, there were no significant gender differences within the groups. the commissural height on smiling increased significantly with age in both sexes. the reason for increase in intercommissural width and commissure height with age could be due to the sagging at the corners of the mouth reported as a result of an increase in resting muscle length with age (levator anguli oris, zygomaticus minor, and zygomaticus major). these results were consistent with the idea that activity and function of the muscles involved in smile decrease with age. loss of skin elasticity and volume can also contribute to increased wrinkles at the corners of the lip, making it difficult to identify the commissures.","{'answer_start': [1390], 'text': ['levator anguli oris, zygomaticus minor, and zygomaticus major']}",,anatomy,"{'authors': ['Patil Chetan', 'Pradeep Tandon', 'Gulshan K.

"in patients with asymmetric arch form in the transverse dimension, what can be used to treat dental asymmetries?","a transverse discrepancy of the upper and lower dentition can cause a unilateral posterior crossbite, unilateral large posterior overjet, or both. transverse asymmetry can be classified into skeletal and dental origins. burstone insisted that the axial inclination of molars can be used as the basis of classification. according to him, a skeletal transverse asymmetry is a transverse discrepancy with a normal axial inclination of the molars, while a dental transverse asymmetry involves the unilateral abnormal axial inclination of the molars. the symmetric transverse discrepancy of upper and lower dentition can be treated with various proposed modalities: transpalatal arch (tpa), palatal expander, lingual arch, etc. if the patient is an adult with a skeletal transverse discrepancy, surgically assisted expansion or constriction of the maxilla is a viable option. however, if the nature of the transverse discrepancy is unilateral, which is the asymmetric transverse dimension of the dentition, the abovementioned modalities may not be optimal or valid methods. to overcome such a challenging situation, the sophisticated application of tpa or the use of unilateral posterior cross elastics has been suggested. if the asymmetric transverse dimension is of skeletal origin, a unilateral corticotomy or segmental osteotomy can be performed. however, orthodontic biomechanics always involve unwanted tooth movement in instances of dental anchorage, such as when pure unilateral expansion or constriction with a transpalatal arch or lingual arch is not possible and cross elastics may cause the extrusion of teeth and may induce side effects on the normal opposing dentition. surgical options place a heavy burden on patients and have a poor cost-to-benefit ratio when the amount of discrepancy is small. skeletal anchorages have been actively used in clinical orthodontics in recent years. they provide absolute anchorage and avoid unwanted tooth movement. adapting skeletal anchorage to correct the asymmetric transverse dimension of dentition can be an excellent biomechanical option. the aim of this report is to present a biomechanical method to control maxillary dentition transverse dimension in an asymmetrical way using two orthodontic miniscrews implanted in the palatal bone. in addition, two patients with asymmetric posterior overjet treated with the method are presented.","{'answer_start': [1144], 'text': ['tpa or the use of unilateral posterior cross elastics']}",,biomechanics,"{'authors': ['Hye-Young Kwon', 'Su-Jung Mah', 'Yoon-Goo Kang'], 'doi': 'https://doi.org/10.2319/042514-302.1', 'meta': 'Angle Orthod (2015) 85 (3): 525–534.', 'title': 'Asymmetric transverse control of maxillary dentition with two midpalatal orthodontic miniscrews'}",c043b2a4-7a65-4caa-9788-0779a2cb88b4
"regarding soft tissue changes in untreated subjects, how does the profile change with age?","although the lips were more retrusive relative to esthetic plane in both groups following treatment, the amount of this change was the same for each group. this decrease in facial profile convexity secondary to orthodontic treatment has also been reported by numerous other investigators. cranial base superimpositions revealed that the chin and nose moved forward relative to the lips by similar amounts in both groups, and it appeared that this mandibular growth and nasal development contributed more to the flattening of the profile than did actual lip retraction. the amount of mandibular growth and nasal development that occurred during treatment was not statistically different between extraction and nonextraction groups. during the mean post-retention period of 14 years, significant flattening of the profile continued to occur, but these changes were also the same in each group. consequently, the long-term facial profiles were the same, independent of whether or not premolar extraction was performed. this continued decrease in facial convexity was also observed during a 3- to 5-year post-retention interval by finnoy et al, who observed that this soft tissue change was the same in spite of differences in long-term incisor position. in the present study, the significant and similar amounts of mandibular growth and nasal development observed during the post-retention interval surpassed the slight forward movement of the lips and resulted in further long-term retrusion of the lips relative to the nose and chin. a thinning of the upper lip occurred during this period as well. as there were no differences between groups in these post-retention changes, it appears that the flattening of the profile that occurred with time was primarily due to maturational changes associated with continued mandibular growth and nasal development and is not influenced by tooth removal. progressive flattening of the facial profile has been well documented in numerous untreated samples as well as in long-term post-treatment studies. these long-term post-treatment studies also found, incidentally, that there were no differences in long-term lip position when comparing extraction and nonextraction samples. prior to treatment, lip position in both groups was protrusive relative to the nose and chin based upon the esthetic ideals proposed by ricketts 4 mm for the upper lip and 2 mm for the lower lip. lip position relative to the s line was also more protrusive than steiner's ideal of the lips lying tangent to this plane. although the initial profiles were also more protrusive than the values reported by forsberg and odenrick for untreated normals of this age group, they were very similar to values reported by others. following active treatment, lip position relative to the nose and chin was the same in each group, with both groups exhibiting moderately more lip retrusion than ricketts ideals and the values reported for untreated normals of this age group by bishara et al, beget, and nanda et al.","{'answer_start': [1893], 'text': ['progressive flattening of the facial profile']}",,growth,"{'authors': ['Eileen C.

"describe the procedure of accelerated osteogenic orthodontics [when is corticotomy indicated?, what is rap?]","in our modified mandibular corticotomy technique, lingual subapical horizontal and vertical cuts were not performed so as to support the blood supply of the mandibular dentoalveolar region by lingual mucosa and to protect the thin roots of the incisors in the region where there is difficult access and possibility of damaging the teeth. labial subapical horizontal cuts were omitted to protect overlying cortical bone and to maintain the blood supply of the incisors because the spongiosa bone was not left intact. although some animal experiments and case reports regarding the effects of segmental alveolar movement after corticotomy revealed no damages in the pulp and no adverse effects on the periodontium of the teeth, it was also reported that reactive inflammation of pulp and vacuolar degeneration in maxillary anterior teeth were observed after protraction with two-stage corticotomy in the maxilla. after our modified surgery, no problems of inadequate blood supply, devitalization of the teeth, root resorption, or gingival recession occurred. in the developmental process of corticotomy procedure, the marginal bone was excluded from the operation side in an attempt to protect the crestal bone and periodontal membrane, which may be highly vulnerable after subapical osteotomies accompanied by vertical corticotomies. in accordance with these instructions, the vertical cuts were advised to begin 2 3 mm below the alveolar crest in a technique proposed by suya. however, in our modified technique, because the crestal bone and the periodontal membrane were supported by the intact lingual mucosa, the vertical cuts were extended to the gingival margin on the buccal side with no adverse effects at the end of treatment. reduction of orthodontic therapy time is considered to be an important goal in the management of malocclusions. corticotomy has been proposed as an alternative to conventional orthodontic treatment in difficult adult cases for rapid tooth movement. in the present case, corticotomy-facilitated lower incisor retraction was accomplished in 1.5 months. chung et al reported that the complete retraction of anterior teeth combined with corticotomy in a case with severe bimaxillary protrusion took less than 3.5 months. according to the clinical observations of d ker, the required position of the teeth after corticotomy could be achieved even earlier than 1.5 3 months. in the current case report, the total orthodontic treatment time (16 months) was dramatically reduced when compared with the average treatment time for extraction therapy (31 months). in corticotomy-facilitated orthodontics, the reduction of orthodontic treatment time by approximately 50% was observed.","{'answer_start': [1880], 'text': ['an alternative to conventional orthodontic treatment in difficult adult cases for rapid tooth movement']}",,biology,"{'authors': ['Derya Germeç', 'Bahadir Giray', 'Ilken Kocadereli', 'Ayhan Enacar†'], 'doi': 'https://doi.org/10.1043/0003-3219(2006)076[0882:LIRWAM]2.0.CO;2', 'meta': 'Angle Orthod (2006) 76 (5): 882–890.', 'title': 'Lower Incisor Retraction with a Modified Corticotomy'}",085a172e-9bab-4338-8c9a-1995fbaa8797
"with regards to bone metabolism, what is the function of bone morphogenetic proteins (bmps)?","postorthodontic stability is a highly controversial issue that is difficult to ensure unless long-term permanent mechanical retention is used. beside mechanical retention, additional procedures are also used to minimize pos orthodontic relapse, such as fibrotomy and reshaping the teeth, but none of these methods is satisfactory and reliable. in addition, long-term permanent mechanical retention represents an extra burden on patients. the mechanism behind relapse is not fully understood and has been blamed on many factors, such as the recoil of the gingival and periodontal fibers, surrounding soft tissue, further growth, and dental factors. there is a general agreement that postorthodontic retention is a highly variable and complex procedure, which cannot be ensured unless permanently in place. therefore, finding a logical and safe solution for the unavoidable relapse represents a necessity, especially in the presence of the great advances in scientific research. topical administration of a bisphosphonate (risedronate), a potent blocker of bone resorption, during orthodontic tooth movements has been evaluated in rats. risedronate inhibited tooth movement in a dose-dependent manner without affecting the overall growth of the animals. these data suggested the possibility of manipulating bone remolding to temporarily minimize postorthodontic relapse. bone morphogenetic proteins (bmps) are members of the transforming growth factor (tgf-b) superfamily that act as osteoinductive factors by inducing differentiation of osteoblasts from mesenchymal cells. previous studies have shown the ability of bmps to induce bone formation in a variety of models with many clinical applications in orthopedics and in oral and maxillofacial/dental areas. demineralized freeze-dried bone allografts (dfdba), which are known to contain bmps, have been used and tested extensively for periodontal regeneration. histologic evidence of enhanced formation of bone, cementum, and connective tissue attachment has been demonstrated in human periodontal defects. dynagraft ii (isotis orthobiologics inc, irvine, calif) is a commercially available dried bone matrix (dbm), which is a type of dfdba. it is designed to promote bone formation by stimulating the proliferation and transformation of mesenchymal cells to osteoblasts. it has many orthopedic applications, such as augmentation or reconstruction of alveolar ridges. the theory of this research is based on (1) the need to solve the dilemma of the unavoidable relapse unless permanent mechanical retention is used, (2) the possibility of using a biologically safe osteoinductive material to regenerate bone and cementum in the periodontium, and (3) the possibility of controlling tooth movement through the use of biological materials. the goals of this study were to evaluate the use of bmps as contained in dbm to prevent relapse after orthodontic treatment in sheep and to develop a biological method to prevent or minimize relapse after orthodontic treatment.","{'answer_start': [1482], 'text': ['osteoinductive factors by inducing differentiation of osteoblasts from mesenchymal cells']}",,biology,"{'authors': ['Ali H.

"when covering denuded roots, which procedure gives the greatest width of keratinized gingiva?","membranes and subepithelial grafts equivocal for treating recession. occasionally, after nonextraction orthodontic treatment in some adult patients with thin gingiva, the patient may develop a dehiscence over the root of a proclined tooth. this is usually due to inadequate attached gingiva and an underlying dehiscence. ten years ago, it was difficult to cover these roots once recession had occurred. however, today two options are available for grafting tissue over denuded roots. one procedure involves harvesting a connective tissue graft from the palate and placing it over the root. this is a highly predictable procedure, but requires two surgical sites. another option is to place a resorbable membrane over the exposed root to avoid palatal surgery. but are the results from both procedures the same? a study published in the journal of periodontology (1999; 70:123-130) compared these two modes of root coverage. the sample consisted of 14 individuals with at least two sites that required grafting. a split-mouth design was used, and one defect was grafted with connective tissue while the other was grafted with a resorbable membrane. the sites were compared 6 months postoperatively. the results showed no differences in the amount of root coverage between these two procedures. the only difference was greater width of keratinized gingiva using connective tissue grafts. therefore, the techniques were equivocal, and either can be used to cover denuded roots after gingival recession.","{'answer_start': [1360], 'text': ['connective tissue grafts']}",,clinical,"{'authors': ['Vincent Kokich, DDS, MSD'], 'doi': 'https://doi.org/10.1043/0003-3219(1999)069<0293:WSNID>2.3.CO;2', 'meta': 'Angle Orthod (1999) 69 (4): 293–294.', 'title': ""What's new in dentistry""}",5c7666c1-c47c-4cc7-bee3-e5114187d6f2
"regarding impacted canines, is there a gender predilection?","nodine reported that impacted and migrated mandibular canines are often discovered without having produced any apparent symptoms suggestive of their presence. during the initial examination of a 12- or 14-year-old orthodontic patient demonstrating the absence of the permanent canine from the mandibular arch, the permanent canine may be suspected to be in an impacted position in the jaw. the prolonged retention of the deciduous canine is quite often a reliable clue leading to the discovery of its impacted permanent successor. it is possible that routine full-mouth intraoral dental radiographs may fail to reveal impacted canines. however, since the advent of panoramic radiography, it has become rather easy to detect a migratory tooth, and it is possible that more cases will be reported in the future. twenty-seven of the patients observed in this investigation did not have any symptoms as far as the impacted canines were concerned. only 1 patient (figure 1), in whom both canines had erupted on the labial aspect on the left side in a mirror-image position, complained of unsightly appearance of teeth while smiling. ando and associates also reported that they had not observed any symptoms such as pain or oppression of mandibular nerve owing to the transmigration of canine in their patients. in a very true sense, the transmigration of a tooth should not have any pathological conditions associated with that tooth. however, thoma and shapira et alhave described this anomaly accompanied by a cyst or odontoma. therefore, in the present paper, some cases have been included only on the basis of the canine's having migrated across the midline. it is difficult to say that these pathological conditions were responsible for the transmigration process or the pathological condition occurred after the migration of the canine. the left canine is more involved than the right canine, and women tend to have this condition more frequently than do men. it is not possible to offer any plausible reason for this preference. however, it can be observed that all these patients reported first to the orthodontist for their malocclusion problem, and the impacted unerupted and migratory teeth were detected secondarily during the clinical and radiological examination. among orthodontic patients, women are usually more common than men, and this would also reflect on such findings in this study. the distance traveled by the mandibular canine in the process of migration, as reported from the literature cited in this paper, ranged from a position below the central incisor roots on the opposite side to a position below the distal root of first permanent molar on the opposite side. according to javid, an impacted mandibular canine that has crossed the midline more than half of its length should be considered as transmigrated. however, the present author feels that not the distance of migration after crossing the midline, but the tendency of a canine to cross the barrier of the mandibular midline suture is a more important consideration. moreover, it will also depend in what stage of transmigration the tooth is when the orthodontist or the oral surgeon first sees the patient.","{'answer_start': [1898], 'text': ['women tend to have this condition more frequently than do men']}",,pathology,"{'authors': ['M.

"regarding the biomechanics of orthodontic tooth movement, where is the center of rotation located during translation?","the second method by which tooth movement can be effected is through the application of a pair of equal forces which are parallel, noncolinear, and of opposite direction, termed a couple (figure 2). this system, applied anywhere on a tooth, creates only a tendency for rotation referred to as the moment of the couple whose magnitude is equal to one of the forces of the couple multiplied by the inter-force distance. the center of rotation resulting from the moment of the couple is always coincident with the center of resistance of the tooth irrespective of its point of application. connoting teeth as rigid and accepting the limitation that orthodontic forces do not act directly through the center of resistance, all appliance systems must cause tooth movement through one of these two processes, either alone or in combination. the traditional paradigm describes tooth movement as rotational (tipping) and/or translational (bodily movement), as shown in figures 1 and 3. figure 1 depicts the effect of a single force whose point of application is away from the center of resistance. this configuration causes rotation or tipping, with the center of resistance moving parallel to the line of force. the latter descriptor of tooth movement, that of translation, more complex (figure 3). here, as with rotation, the force is applied away from the center of resistance, again causing rotation or tipping. however, for translation to occur there must concurrently exist a couple with an opposite sense tending to tip the root in the opposite direction as the crown. under these conditions, the relative amount of crown tipping (moment of the force) and root tipping (moment of the couple) expressed at any given moment in time determines the location of an instantaneous center of rotation. when these two oppositely directed moments are equal in magnitude, the center of rotation is at infinity and tooth translation occurs (figure 3). this determinant is also expressed as the moment to force ratio.","{'answer_start': [1860], 'text': ['the center of rotation is at infinity']}",,biomechanics,"{'authors': ['Robert J.

"regarding the step relationships in primary dentition, what is likely to be the molar relationship in permanent dentition in subjects with a distal step?","the terminal plane relationship of the second primary molars can be described as: flush, occurring in 29.4% of the individuals; mesial step, occurring in 61.1%; and distal step, occurring in 9.5% of the individuals. at the time of eruption of the permanent first molars, their initial occlusion is dependent on the terminal plane relationship of the primary second molars. therefore, in about 30% of the population the first molars will erupt into a cusp-to-cusp relationship (ie, with the mesiobuccal cusp of the maxillary first permanent molar anterior to the buccal groove of the mandibular first permanent molar). the findings from the study further indicated that, if the initial occlusion in the permanent dentition has a distal step, the molar relationship in the permanent dentition develops into a class ii. this provides credence to a frequently repeated axiom: once a class ii, always a class ii . since the disto-occlusion in the primary or mixed dentitions will not self-correct with growth, cases with distal steps in the primary dentition should be observed on a regular basis and treatment started as soon as the clinician and the patient are ready. individuals with a flush terminal plane relationship present a more challenging diagnostic question. of these cases, 56% became class i and 44% became class ii in the permanent dentition. in other words, slightly less than half of these cases will progress to a class ii or end-to-end occlusion.48 these findings imply that what was previously considered as normal occlusion in the primary or mixed dentitions, in reality, does not often result in a normal occlusion in the permanent dentition. therefore, it is important for the clinician to closely observe these cases and to initiate treatment when needed at the appropriate time. in the 56.4% of individuals with a flush terminal plane, placing a lower lingual holding arch to maintain space may have an adverse effect on the developing dentition (ie, it may prevent more cases with a flush terminal plane from becoming class i). this is important to remember because orthodontists, pediatric dentists, and general dentists often consider placing a lower lingual arch as a preventive or interceptive but noninvasive procedure. one can readily imagine how maintaining arch length and preventing the mesial drift of the mandibular permanent molars, can adversely affect the changes in the molar relationship from the mixed to the permanent dentitions. as a result, in cases with an end to end molar relationship in which a lingual arch is placed, the clinician should consider using headgear or other appliances to obtain a class i occlusion. the parents should be made aware of such a possibility beforehand. of the cases with a 1 mm mesial step, 76% became class i, 23% became class ii, and 1% became class iii. in cases with a mesial step of 2 mm or more in the primary dentition, 68% became class i, 13% became class ii, and 19% became class iii. these findings indicated that the greater the mesial step, the greater the probability for the molar relationship to develop into a class i occlusion.","{'answer_start': [741], 'text': ['the molar relationship in the permanent dentition develops into a class ii']}",,growth,"{'authors': ['Samir E.

"regarding rapid maxillary expansion, what was the impression of patients regarding their nasal breathing after the therapy?","derichsweiler claimed an increase in nasal width, lowering of the palatal vault, and straightening of the nasal septum as suture opening allowed many mouth-breathers to adapt to the use of the nasal passages for respiration. his histologic examination of extracted human teeth following suture opening revealed no degenerate changes in the periodontal ligament. martenson claimed that the course of nasally inspired air was upward into the middle and superior meatus and then downward through the posterior choanae with air not usually passing through the inferior meatus. increase in apical base measurements from dental casts were reported by gerlach. regarding nasal stenosis, he thought palatal suture opening could have much therapeutic value; however, not every mouth breathing habit can be cured thereby. using metallic implants, krebs demonstrated rotation of the maxillary components in the frontal and sagittal planes with a nasal cavity width gain of 2.5 mm that narrowed to 2.0 mm during two months and nine days of retention. haas, reporting on a clinical study in 1961, stated that patients notice slight to marked improvement in nasal respiration depending on the severity of nasal stenosis at the start of therapy. he recorded stable increases in nasal width from 2 to 4.5 millimeters as judged from frontal cephalograms.","{'answer_start': [1096], 'text': ['patients notice slight to marked improvement in nasal respiration']}",,clinical,"{'authors': ['Robert A.

"in patients who have received rapid maxillary expansion (rme), what is the effect of rme treatment on breathing patterns?","the immediate and long-term effects of rme over the upper airway have been shown in previous studies. the literature shows that patients presenting with maxillary constriction tend to have a higher nasal airway resistance. the present study does not show a difference in nasal air passage volume at t0, but this may be due to the fact that patients with clinically normal respiratory functions for selected for both groups. the maxilla forms most of the lateral walls of the nasal cavity; therefore, an increase in volume in the nasal cavity would be an expected rme effect. the series of events that cause this phenomenon is mainly the triangular or parallel opening of the median palatal suture, which increases the width of the nasal floor and results in an increased volume of the nasal cavity. the present study shows a twofold increase in the np volume after rme. this finding suggests that rme may be able to improve the breathing pattern by reducing nasal resistance, but further studies are needed to confirm such anatomical and functional correlations. farronato et al. reported that the mandibular position changes in various directions when rme is applied to patients with different malocclusions. these differences in mandibular position may affect the op airway size, shape, and volume. the present study did not find significant changes in mandibular position between the rme and control groups. zhao et al. assessed the changes of the op airway on 24 patients with maxillary constriction treated with rme and compared them to 24 age- and sex-matched patients and found no significant increase. they concluded that rme would not enlarge op airway volume. malko et al. evaluated the effects of mandibular symphyseal distraction osteogenesis followed by rme on pharyngeal size and concluded that rme did not significantly affect the pharyngeal dimensions. the present study confirms such findings and also found no effect on pharyngeal airway when using rme.","{'answer_start': [897], 'text': ['rme may be able to improve the breathing pattern by reducing nasal resistance']}",,clinical,"{'authors': ['Hakan El', 'Juan Martin Palomo'], 'doi': 'https://doi.org/10.2319/012313-71.1', 'meta': 'Angle Orthod (2014) 84 (2): 265–273.', 'title': 'Three-dimensional evaluation of upper airway following rapid maxillary expansion: A CBCT study'}",1ee34915-fca7-42c5-aa9b-24b3b0f657d8
"in patients affected by transient bacteremia, which cardiac conditions places patients at risk of infective endocarditis?","a transient bacteremia may follow various dental manipulations including dental prophylactic procedures. this bacteremia places patients with predisposing cardiac conditions at risk for infective endocarditis. these predisposing cardiac conditions include most congenital cardiac malformations, previous infective endocarditis, rheumatic and other acquired valvular dysfunctions, hypertrophic cardiomyopathy, mitral valve prolapse with valvular regurgitation, prosthetic cardiac valves, and surgically constructed systemic-pulmonary shunts. the incidence of bacteremia has been reported for dental procedures such as extraction, root scaling, endodontic treatment, and toothbrushing. bacteremia following orthodontic procedures has been investigated in only a few studies. degling found no microorganisms in the blood stream after orthodontic banding and debanding in 10 patients. in a study of 30 volunteers, mclaughlin et al reported a bacteremia incidence of 10% after banding. a recent study conducted on 40 orthodontic patients found a 7.5% incidence of bacteremia following banding. most orthodontic patients are not able to perform effective plaque control and therefore develop mild to moderate gingivitis during treatment with fixed appliances. as a result of plaque accumulation and subsequent gingivitis, one would expect a higher incidence of bacteremia after debanding procedures compared with banding procedures. the 1997 american heart association guidelines state that endocarditis prophylaxis is recommended for the initial placement of orthodontic bands but not brackets. however, 2 earlier surveys of american and british orthodontists have shown that, while many orthodontists prescribed antibiotics before banding and debanding at-risk patients, a significant portion of orthodontists did not think antibiotic therapy was necessary. this variation in the handling of at-risk patients may be due to lack of data confirming the need for antibiotic prophylaxis before banding and debanding. more studies are needed to clarify this critical issue. this study investigates the incidence of bacteremia after removal of bands and brackets.","{'answer_start': [256], 'text': ['most congenital cardiac malformations, previous infective endocarditis, rheumatic and other acquired valvular dysfunctions, hypertrophic cardiomyopathy, mitral valve prolapse with valvular regurgitation, prosthetic cardiac valves, and surgically constructed systemic-pulmonary shunts']}",,pathology,"{'authors': ['Nejat Erverdi, DDS, PhD', 'Sibel Biren, DDS, PhD', 'Tanju Kadir, PhD', 'Ahu Acar, DDS, PhD'], 'doi': 'https://doi.org/10.1043/0003-3219(2000)070<0011:IOBFOD>2.0.CO;2', 'meta': 'Angle Orthod (2000) 70 (1): 11–14.', 'title': 'Investigation of Bacteremia Following Orthodontic Debanding'}",11112b9c-667e-48c5-b453-ab00ddf9a36d
"regarding orthodontic retention, what are the disadvantages of vacuum-formed retainers?","it has been shown by a number of long-term studies that following a course of orthodontic treatment, relapse occurs in approximately 70% of cases. some of this will be due to orthodontic relapse, and some will be due to normal changes with time, such as continued facial growth. the problem for the orthodontist is that not only is it impossible to predict which cases will undergo relapse, but it is also impossible to predict the degree to which this will occur. relapse is unrelated to factors such as original incisor or molar classification, extractions, or the degree of tooth movement. not only is it difficult to predict which cases will require retention, but there is also currently no consensus on the amount or duration of retainer wear or indeed which type of retainer to use. patients can be provided with either fixed or removable appliances, and various studies have investigated the effectiveness of each. a recent investigation found multistrand bonded retainers to be more effective in maintaining tooth position than single-strand wires. a separate study investigating the effectiveness of bonded multistrand lingual retainers found them to be no more effective in retaining tooth position than a removable hawley-type retainer. in recent years, vacuum-formed retainers have become increasingly popular and for a number of reasons, but principally due to ease fabrication, improved esthetics, and reduced cost. purported disadvantages of vacuum-formed retainers include occlusal wear of the appliance with subsequent cracking in the longer term, along with reduced vertical settling. in terms of their effectiveness, a previous randomized controlled trial found vacuum-formed retainers to be as effective as hawley retainers in maintaining incisor alignment, although it has been suggested that they are not able to maintain arch expansion as well as a hawley. the aim of the current study was to compare the effectiveness of vacuum-formed and hawley retainers in maintaining arch width as well as incisor alignment.","{'answer_start': [1490], 'text': ['occlusal wear of the appliance with subsequent cracking in the longer term, along with reduced vertical settling']}",,clinical,"{'authors': ['Stephen Barlin', 'Roland Smith', 'Ray Reed', 'Jonathan Sandy', 'Anthony John Ireland'], 'doi': 'https://doi.org/10.2319/072610-437.1', 'meta': 'Angle Orthod (2011) 81 (3): 404–409.', 'title': 'A retrospective randomized double-blind comparison study of the effectiveness of Hawley vs vacuum-formed retainers'}",1be4a5bd-8c6a-44db-9cb9-4e918d7c37c8

"in class ii patients, how does the bionator improve the maxillomandibular relationship?","lateral cephalograms have become one of the major diagnostic tools in the study of facial growth changes and modifications induced by orthodontic/orthopedic treatment. conventional cephalometrics enables identification of skeletal, dental, and soft tissue problems in patients with malocclusions in addition to being still widely employed to evaluate angular and linear measures. although conventional cephalometric analysis (cca) is individualized, it does not always prove effective in determining accurately the location and mode in which changes in shape and size occur within the craniofacial complex. thus, cca has no theoretical foundation, but it is rather governed by conventions involving points and planes, which fail to capture curvilinear forms and changes in these forms. as science evolved, geometric morphometrics emerged as an alternative method to address these issues and eventually overcome the difficulties posed by cca. one such alternative is thin-plate spline (tps) analysis that assesses spatial changes in the shape of complex skeletal structures, affording reliable graphic and mathematical representations. tps does not require any reference or superimposition planes. this morphometric analysis quantitatively evaluates changes in shape, expressing the differences between the configurations of two reference points as a continuous deformation. it also allows the construction of transformation grids that capture differences in form, enabling a more effective visual interpretation. thus, tps allows precise viewing of the set of changes occurring in facial skeletal structures. these morphometric methods can shed light on the skeletal effects arising from the use of orthopedic appliances in the treatment of malocclusions. among different therapies available to treat class ii malocclusion, the balters bionator is a functional appliance designed and introduced by wilhelm balters in the 1960s. the bionator moves the mandible anteriorly so that over time a new postural position of the lower arch is achieved, improving the maxillomandibular relationship. while short-term and long-term effects of the bionator appliance on class ii division 1 malocclusion have been previously investigated, the cca methods used in those studies do now allow understanding of the changes in mandibular morphology (shape) that occur with bionator therapy. the aim of this study, therefore, was to investigate the effects of the standard (class ii) balters bionator in the treatment of patients with class ii malocclusion with mandibular retrusion using tps analysis.","{'answer_start': [1941], 'text': ['moves the mandible anteriorly so that over time a new postural position of the lower arch is achieved']}",,clinical,"{'authors': ['Carina Ferlin Antunes', 'Renato Bigliazzi', 'Francisco Antonio Bertoz', 'Cristina Lúcia Feijó Ortolani', 'Lorenzo Franchi', 'Kurt Faltin, Jr.'], 'doi': 'https://doi.org/10.2319/072512-605.1', 'meta': 'Angle Orthod (2013) 83 (3): 455–459.', 'title': 'Morphometric analysis of treatment effects of the Balters bionator in growing Class II patients'}",43bab3ad-e497-4276-baa9-d62baf3a60a5
"regarding smile esthetics, how should the gingival margins of the maxillary lateral incisor be positioned relative to gingival margins of the maxillary canines?","indications for orthodontic space closure in patients with missing central incisors and the proposed treatment alternatives have been discussed in some previous studies. the applicability of moving maxillary incisors through the midline was sometimes questioned. concerns were expressed regarding the treatment complexity, the risk for space reopening, the quality of the esthetic results, and, mainly, the difficulty of tooth movement across the midpalatal suture. the present results indicated that anterior space closure by moving the contralateral maxillary incisor is challenging and time-consuming. when a maxillary lateral incisor substitutes a missing central incisor, several important steps will ensure an esthetic result. first, the gingival margins of the teeth must be properly positioned. the gingival margin of the central incisors should match the level of the maxillary canines, and the gingival margin of the lateral incisors should be positioned slightly coronally. to reach this morphology, the substituting lateral incisor must be significantly intruded so that its gingival margin matches the adjacent central incisor. the gingival levels over the two central incisors should be at the same height for a satisfactory esthetic result. the maxillary canine that will replace the lateral incisor should be extruded to move its gingival margin incisally to resemble the usual gingival margin position of the lateral incisor. in addition, by intruding the substituting lateral incisor, the restoration of this tooth into the shape of a central incisor is simplified. when the lateral incisor is restored to simulate a central incisor, it is difficult to create an ideal crown form because the mesial and distal surfaces of the crown must be overcontoured because of the narrower cervical region of the lateral incisor. besides establishing an adequate crown length, intrusion of the lateral incisor allows that the proximal surfaces of the crown can be tapered gradually from the cervical margin to the incisal edge. in this case report, the right lateral incisor was intruded using wire bends during orthodontic finishing. however, an initial individualized bonding placing the bracket of the right lateral incisor closer to the incisal edge would be a better and more efficient choice. gingivectomy cannot be performed after orthodontic treatment in these cases once the gingival sulcus of the lateral incisor shows a normal depth.","{'answer_start': [944], 'text': ['should be positioned slightly coronally']}",,clinical,"{'authors': ['Daniela Gamba Garib', 'Guilherme Janson', 'Patrícia Bittencourt Dutra dos Santos', 'Taiana de Oliveira Baldo', 'Gabriela Ulian de Oliveira', 'Sérgio Kiyoshi Ishikiriama'], 'doi': 'https://doi.org/10.2319/022111-125.1', 'meta': 'Angle Orthod (2012) 82 (2): 370–379.', 'title': 'Orthodontic movement of a maxillary incisor through the midpalatal suture: A case report'}",31eb385c-3ae2-4e25-ba9e-f3a4ef137a8a
"in growing class ii patients with mandibular retrusion, when is the optimal time for twin block therapy?","in recent times, the analysis of the effectiveness of the bionator appliance when compared with the twin-block is becoming the most popular alternative clinical option for functional treatment of class-ii malocclusion. the most favorable time period to start treatment with the twin-block is during or slightly after the peak in mandibular growth. the short-term supplementary mandibular increment that can be obtained with the twin-block at puberty is approximately 4.7 mm/y. a similar amount of additional mandibular growth when compared with untreated subjects is found in patients treated with the bionator appliance at the pubertal growth spurt. however, in bionator therapy this clinical result is achieved in a two-year time interval, which is twice the duration of the interval for active twin-block therapy. regardless of the differences in both the mode of action and the clinical management of the two functional appliances, both the bionator and the twin-block are effective therapeutic means for class-ii treatment associated with mandibular deficiency. nevertheless, the twin-block appears to be more efficient in terms of a shorter duration of treatment time interval (on average 14 months vs 22 months for the bionator appliance). data regarding the long-term outcomes of twin-block therapy are needed for a definitive appraisal of the stability of the very favorable short-term dentoskeletal changes. posttreatment stability appears to be a feature of bionator therapy followed by fixed appliances to refine occlusion, both in prepubertal and pubertal patients. none of the skeletal parameters exhibited any relapse after active therapy in the present study. this finding is evident particularly in the ltg, which still showed small favorable changes even during the retention period.","{'answer_start': [292], 'text': ['during or slightly after the peak']}",,clinical,"{'authors': ['Kurt Faltin, Jr, DDS, PhD', 'Rolf M.

"regarding the mechanical properties of orthodontic wires, which factors influence wire stiffness?","unloading curves were nonlinear for many of the multistrand stainless steel and for all the nickel-titanium wires. it was not possible to define a single value of stiffness or slope of the bending plot for these wires. these results have supported the use of the polynomial regression method used in this investigation to determine the stiffnesses of these wire samples over a range of deflections. this methodology allows the evaluation of the instantaneous stiffness in standard mechanical tests and for orthodontic appliance systems. the results of this investigation have shown that wire stiffness can be altered not only by size but also by varying the number of strands and the alloy composition of the wire. this supports the concept of variable modulus orthodontics, which suggests changing stiffness by changing the elastic modulus rather than changing the wire size. the stiffnesses noted at different deflections for the multistrand stainless steel wires were variable in contrast to the constant stiffnesses recorded for the single-strand stainsteel wires. wire selections in clinical practice should include considerations of the alloy type, wire cross-section, and number of strands. all three factors are found to have a profound influence on wire stiffness.","{'answer_start': [587], 'text': ['wire stiffness can be altered not only by size but also by varying the number of strands and the alloy composition of the wire']}",,materials,"{'authors': ['Jay M.

"in brazilian adolescent, what is the prevalence of handicapping malocclusion?","objective: to investigate the association between malocclusion/dentofacial anomalies and traumatic dental injuries (tdi) in adolescents. materials and methods: the sample of this cross-sectional study comprised 509 adolescents aged 11 to 14 years enrolled at public schools in the city of os rio, southern brazil. parents answered a structured questionnaire addressing demographic and socioeconomic characteristics. an examiner who had undergone a training and calibration exercise recorded malocclusion/dentofacial anomalies (dental aesthetic index, dai), tdi (andreasen), and dental caries (world health organisation). statistical analyses (spss software) involved poisson regression with robust variance. results: the prevalence of tdi was 11.6%, and the prevalence of defined, severe, and handicapping malocclusion was 24.0%, 21.6%, and 22.0%, respectively. the multivariate analysis demonstrated that the probability of tdi was approximately twofold higher among adolescents with severe malocclusion (prevalence ratio [pr] 2.22; 95% confidence interval [ci] 1.14 4.31) and handicapping malocclusion (pr 1.95; 95% ci 1.01 3.85) in comparison to those with normal occlusion or minor malocclusion. defined malocclusion was not significantly associated with the outcome. among the dentofacial anomalies evaluated, the probability of tdi was nearly twofold higher among adolescents with overjet greater than 3 mm (pr 1.96; 95% ci 1.14 3.37) and 2.2-fold higher among those with an abnormal molar relationship (pr 2.24; 95% ci 1.17 4.32), after controlling for confounding variables. conclusions: severe and handicapping malocclusion, accentuated overjet, and abnormal molar relationship were strongly associated with the occurrence of tdi. future studies should investigate whether the treatment of these conditions can help reduce the occurrence of tdi in adolescents.","{'answer_start': [841], 'text': ['22.0%']}",,clinical,"{'authors': ['Paulo Floriani Kramer', 'Luciana M.

"regarding the growth of the craniofacial complex, how are facial bones formed?","because chronological age is not a valid predictor of skeletal growth velocity or skeletal maturity, conventionally, hand-wrist radiographs have been used to determine skeletal maturation. validity of skeletal maturity assessment using the hand-wrist radiograph in relation to the standing height (body skeletal growth velocity) has been well established for several racial groups. although moore pointed out that most of the bones of the body are preformed in cartilage and later developed by endochondral ossification, the facial bones are formed by intramembranous ossification without cartilaginous precursors. therefore, growth of the face may be regulated by factors other than those responsible for growth of the long bones. furthermore, the craniofacial structures include several functional regions that may have different growth responses to systemic and local environmental conditions. recently, the use of cervical vertebrae maturation has been suggested as a valid replacement to the hand-wrist evaluation. the main advantage of the cervical vertebrae maturation evaluation is that it can be obtained from a conventional lateral cephalogram, which would avoid an extra radiation exposure for the patients. the results of this study suggested that although the correlation values between both methods were high (0.72), they could only predict around 50% of the other method's skeletal maturation determination. previous research found that correlation values between skeletal maturation determined from hand-wrist radiographs and cervical vertebrae evaluation were quite variable (from 0.45 to 0.97) (table 4). differences between the results of this study and the reported comparison studies can be expected on the basis of the factors such as sample size, sex, or specific methods used.","{'answer_start': [549], 'text': ['by intramembranous ossification without cartilaginous precursors']}",,growth,"{'authors': ['Carlos Flores-Mir', 'Corr A.

"regarding biomechanics of orthodontic tooth movement, what forces are required to achieve pure translation?","pure rotation or tipping occurs when the center of rotation and center of resistance are at the same point. pure translation occurs when the center of rotation is at infinity. pure rotation requires a couple or two opposite and equal forces. pure translation requires a single force acting through the center of resistance or a single force not through the center of resistance but with a properly balanced couple. a single force not acting through the center of resistance and without a couple creates translation and rotation. the center of resistance translates but, in addition, the body will rotate about the center of resistance. there also occurs an instantaneous center of rotation for the system somewhere between infinity and the center of resistance. this center of rotation is related to the perpendicular distance between the force vector and the center resistance. the framework of the attachment mechanism can be adjusted by extension arms so that when the force is applied, it, in effect, will be traveling through the center of resistance or at any distance from it that is desired. the facebow is a good example of this method. while the framework of the facebow may take on many designs and points of attachment to the tooth, the effect on the dental unit is ultimately only related to the shortest perpendicular distance between the force vector and the center of resistance. 1 1 fundamental physics teaches that the shortest perpendicular distance between a force vector and the center of resistance of a body determines the center of rotation. figure 5 illustrates these principles as they apply to headgear systems. regardless of the design of the facebow or j hook, the body (tooth) reacts to the force system of the headgear that is computed by figuring the shortest perpendicular distance from the force vector to the center of resistance. this distance dictates how the tooth moves and, more specifically, where the instantaneous center of rotation will be (fig. 6).","{'answer_start': [268], 'text': ['a single force acting through the center of resistance or a single force not through the center of resistance but with a properly balanced couple']}",,biomechanics,"{'authors': ['FRANK W.

"in patient which have received lip bumper therapy, where is the greatest overall change arch width increase?","during lip bumper treatment (t1-t2), the arch width significantly increased for all measurements (figure 1). the greatest change was observed in the first premolars, with a 4.48 mm increase, and the least in the canines, with a 2.15 mm increase. the majority of all the increase in arch width occurred from t1 to t2. during fixed appliance therapy following the lip bumper (t2-t3), statistically insignificant increases or decreases in arch width occurred for all teeth. the increase in arch width was greatest for the first premolars (4.61 mm) and least for the canines (2.20 mm). during posttreatment (t3-t4), the mean arch width decreased for all teeth. the decreases for the canines and first molars were statistically insignificant, whereas the decreases for the first and second premolars were significant. the overall changes (t1-t4) in arch width were significant for all measurements. the canines showed the smallest increase (1.78 mm) and the first premolars the largest (3.39 mm). significant changes in the irregularity index were observed for all time periods (figure 2). during lip bumper treatment (t1-t2), the irregularity decreased, and during fixed treatment (t2-t3), it decreased again for a total of 3.73 mm. after the active treatment (t3-t4), the irregularity index increased 0.76 mm. thus, the overall change in the irregularity index (t1-t4) was a decrease of 2.97 mm. during lip bumper treatment (t1-t2), arch length significantly increased (figure 3). however, during fixed appliance therapy (t2-t3), much of this increase was lost. during posttreatment (t3-t4), the arch length continued to decrease significantly (1.23 mm). the overall (t1-t4) change in arch length was 0.89 mm. during lip bumper treatment (t1-t2), arch depth significantly increased (figure 3). however, during fixed appliance therapy (t2-t3), much of this increase was lost. during posttreatment (t3-t4), the arch depth continued to decrease significantly. the overall (t1-t4) change in arch depth was 1.30 mm. for the mixed group, the largest increase in arch width from t1 to t2 was at the first premolars (5.21 mm) and the smallest at the canines (2.39 mm). the t1-t3 increase was largest at the first premolars (5.71 mm) and smallest at the canines (2.40 mm). from t3 to t4, the arch width decreased for all teeth. the decreases were insignificant for the canines (0.42 mm) and first molars (0.68 mm) but significant for the first (1.25 mm) and second premolars (1.49 mm).","{'answer_start': [145], 'text': ['the first premolars']}",,clinical,"{'authors': ['Michael Joseph Solomon', 'Jeryl D.

what is the effect of pacifier and finger sucking habits lasting more than 24 months on the prevalence of crossbites?,"in children with nonnutritive sucking habits and those with prolonged bottle feeding, the different involvement of orofacial muscles and different impact on the palate are presumably responsible for the poor alignment of teeth and the anomalous transverse growth of the palateconditions that lead to posterior crossbite. the nonnutritive sucking habit also seems to be one of the most important factors influencing malocclusion, regardless of whether a child has ds or not. a brazilian study involving 330 four-year-old children observed anterior open bite and posterior crossbite in children with nonnutritive sucking habits, regardless of the duration of the habit. children with pacifier sucking habits lasting for more than 24 months and finger sucking habits had an approximately threefold increased prevalence of anterior and posterior crossbite, which is in agreement with the findings of previous studies. such results stress the influence of external factors on the genetic trait of ds in the etiology of these malocclusions. a number of studies point out that individuals with ds are more prone to anterior/posterior crossbite owing to the combination of clinical aspects of the syndrome (small midface, protrusive tongue, and high palate). nonetheless, the influence of extrinsic factors, such as nonnutritive sucking habits, cannot be ignored. the duration of thumb sucking habits was not analyzed in the present study, as there was a report of only one child with a thumb sucking habit for fewer than 24 months. thus, only the presence or absence of this habit was considered. in a longitudinal study carried out in the united states with 372 normal children with primary teeth, an increase in the prevalence of anterior open bite and posterior crossbite was found among those children with nonnutritive sucking habits lasting until 24 or more months of age. however, when these children continued the habit to 48 months of age, the prevalence of these types of malocclusion was even higher. anterior open bite is often spontaneously corrected in individuals who abandon a finger sucking habit before the pubertal growth spurt.","{'answer_start': [768], 'text': ['an approximately threefold increased prevalence of anterior and posterior crossbite']}",,pathology,"{'authors': ['Ana Cristina Oliveira', 'Isabela Almeida Pordeus', 'Cintia Silva Torres', 'Milene Torres Martins', 'Saul Martins Paiva'], 'doi': 'https://doi.org/10.2319/072709-421.1', 'meta': 'Angle Orthod (2010) 80 (4): 748–753.', 'title': 'Feeding and nonnutritive sucking habits and prevalence of open bite and crossbite in children/adolescents with Down syndrome'}",ce3b1ba0-1559-4d3c-b985-278146cb3309
"according to moorrees, how many stages are there of root resorption for deciduous molars and canines?","the present cross-sectional study was conducted on orthopantomograms of 1245 greek children (590 males and 655 females), whose ages ranged from 6 years 10 months to 14 years. age and sex distributions are shown in table 1. the files of three orthodontists were the source of the orthopantomograms, which were taken before orthodontic treatment commenced. all films were examined on an illuminated viewer. deciduous teeth (and their permanent successors) were excluded when they showed pulp treatment, extensive untreated caries, extensive fillings, abnormal root resorption, or when the permanent successor was missing. (and their predecessors) were excluded if they were peg-shaped or impacted or if their deciduous predecessors had a deciduous tooth was considered extracted if it was not present in the and its antimere was pathological or at res1/2 stage or at an earlier stage of root resorption. according to many investigators, all these local factors influence the rate of root resorption and the reliability of a study of this nature. furthermore, we also excluded several teeth because we were unable to precisely identify the root resorption or formation stage (table 2). the main reasons were errors made during exposure and orthopantomogram distortion. five stages of root resorption of the deciduous mandibular canines and molars were determined according to the method introduced by moorrees et al. these stages and their symbols are presented in figure 1. according to knott and omeara and omeara and knott, in the process of root resorption there is not always a symmetrical reduction of the length of the root. therefore, we frequently judged and estimated the degree and the stage of root resorption not by the symmetrical reduction of the length of the root but by the reduction in the original shape of the root. superimposed the possible original root shape on the resorbed root shape in order to evaluate the exact degree of root resorption. the process of root formation was divided into eight stages. these stages and their symbols are presented in figure 2 and are similar to those introduced by fanning, but due to limitations of the orthopantomograms it was impossible to add three apical stages for greater precision. therefore, the (apex closed) started when more than one-half of the apex was closed.","{'answer_start': [1266], 'text': ['five stages of root resorption of the deciduous mandibular canines and molars']}",,growth,"{'authors': ['Nikos B.

"regarding dental cast analysis, what is the facial axis of the clinical crown (facc)?","impressions of the dental arches were taken using an alginate impression material mixed to a standard consistency. dental stone also was mixed to a standard consistency to pour into the impressions. the completed maxillary and mandibular models were mounted in centric relation on a panadent psl articulator panadent corporation, grand terrace, ca (figure 1a). the teeth were cut and rearranged in wax into maximum intercuspation according to the treatment plan established for each patient based on the ricketts vto. a cusp-embrasure relationship with abc contacts was established to create the occlusion, which was considered morphologically and functionally ideal as an orthodontic treatment goal (figure 1b). all the setup models were provided with proper canine and anterior guidance based on the arch form derived from japanese nonorthodontic normal subjects (figure 2). the setup models were accurately duplicated with an agar impression material to avoid any distortion caused by wax shrinkage that would adversely affect the measurements. the duplicates were used to make the actual measurements (figure 3). the facial axis of the clinical crown (facc) was established by andrews' method and marked with a pencil on the facial surface of each crown. the facc line represented the most prominent portion of the facial central lobe for all teeth except molars. the buccal groove was used for the molars. in addition, midpoints of the faccs of the left and right central incisors and first molars were connected with a continuous line as if a straight orthodontic wire were placed at the end of appliance therapy. the intersection of this line with the facc of each crown was named a tentative facial axis (fa) point, which may be slightly more gingival or occlusal to the original fa point, and was used as a convenient reference point for the measurements. two-millimeter-thick, rigid, flat acrylic plates were trimmed to the maxillary and mandibular arch shapes with recessed areas for cuspids as described by andrews. they were used as reference occlusal planes for the measurements. each acrylic plate was set over the occlusal surfaces of the respective arch so that it touched the incisal edges of the central incisors as well as the cusp tips of the maxillary and the mandibular terminal molars. crown angulation, crown inclination, crown prominence, vertical and horizontal crown contour, and maxillary molar offset were measured in the manner shown in figures 4 through 8. crown angulation, the mesiodistal angle formed by the facc and a line perpendicular to the occlusal plane, was measured using the arch-shaped acrylic plate and a stainless steel protractor as shown in figure 4.","{'answer_start': [1285], 'text': ['the most prominent portion of the facial central lobe for all teeth except molars']}",,clinical,"{'authors': ['Kazuya Watanabe, DDS, PhD', 'Masatada Koga, DDS, PhD'], 'doi': 'https://doi.org/10.1043/0003-3219(2001)071<0499:AMSWSM>2.0.CO;2', 'meta': 'Angle Orthod (2001) 71 (6): 499–511.', 'title': 'A Morphometric Study With Setup Models for Bracket Design'}",63c5ac52-f94d-4f19-bf97-6f8632e49212
"according to the soft tissue paradigm, what primary factor in clinical decision making?","the goals of orthodontic treatment are to improve esthetics and correct the occlusion. the primary concern of patients has been improvement in facial appearance, which is considered an important factor of well-being and social success. recently, a paradigm shift has occurred from hard tissue to soft tissue known as the soft tissue paradigm. according to this reverse approach, the key determinant is soft tissue positions, necessitating evaluating the effects of various orthodontic treatments and their effect on the face. the maxilla is a large facial bone that articulates with 10 facial and cranial bones. the maxilla moves downward and forward after rapid maxillary expansion (rme) and, except for the sphenoid bone, all craniofacial bones articulating with the maxilla also displace. nasal cavity width increases, particularly at the floor of the nose. thus, treatment effects of rme are not only limited to oral structures but are also related to changes in the circummaxillary region. there has been copious literature about the skeletal and dental effects of rme, whereas only scarce information and nonconsensus exist about soft tissue changes. according to the findings of cephalometric studies, nose tip and soft tissue a-point move forward and h angle and profile convexity increase after this treatment. nasal width increase was reported in studies using serial frontal photographs and anthropometric measurements. three-dimensional (3-d) evaluation of widths of the nasal base, mouth, and columella increased with flattening of the nose and upper lip elongation and thinning. 3-d stereophotogrammetry is a method of acquiring images using one or more pairs of simultaneously taken photographs. soft tissue records are easy to capture using optical scanners with short shutter speeds. erratic movement of the patient is not a matter discussion with fast scanning speed. inclusion of surface texture is another advantage of the system. the reproducibility and accuracy of the technique, has been stated to be more than sufficient for clinical needs and has greater accuracy compared with direct anthropometry and 2-d photography. the aim of this prospective clinical trial was to quantify the soft tissue facial changes following rme and to compare these changes with an untreated control group using 3-d facial images. to our knowledge, this study was the first to include a control group to distinguish the changes after rme treatment with those resulting from normal growth and development. the null hypothesis was that soft tissue changes are not significantly different between treatment and control group. also, the soft tissue adaptability to the dento-skeletal changes associated with expansion of the maxilla will be evaluated. in this study, the following hypotheses were tested: (1) there is no difference between rme-treated and untreated subjects regarding soft tissue changes and (2) there is no relation between hard and soft tissue changes.","{'answer_start': [379], 'text': ['the key determinant is soft tissue positions, necessitating evaluating the effects of various orthodontic treatments and their effect on the face']}",,clinical,"{'authors': ['Asli Baysal', 'Mehmet Ali Ozturk', 'Ahmet Oguz Sahan', 'Tancan Uysal'], 'doi': 'https://doi.org/10.2319/111315-766.1', 'meta': 'Angle Orthod (2016) 86 (6): 934–942.', 'title': 'Facial soft-tissue changes after rapid maxillary expansion analyzed with 3-dimensional stereophotogrammetry: A randomized, controlled clinical trial'}",5150a4a5-b2fb-4993-8e54-b7328f438ae4

"in patient with unilateral palatally impacted canines, what is the effect of surgical-orthodontic treatment on pocket depth?","most patients in our study were 20 years old or younger. only two were older than 25 years. the periodontal status of the older subjects after surgical-orthodontic treatment showed no pathologic changes and did not influence our results. the patients were selected from all patients treated during the year 2000 2004 and were not randomly selected. the closed eruption technique is the most often used technique in our university because of advantages presented, for example, by woloshyn and artur and kokich and mathews. we found that surgical-orthodontic treatment affected pocket depth at the mpp on the impacted canine, which was greater (3.1 1.0 mm) than on the control canines (2.4 0.6 mm; p < .01). these findings support those of other research studies. d'amico et al found that pocket depths were greater (by 5%) at the distobuccal surface of the impacted canines and at the mesiolingual, distolingual, and mesiolabial surfaces of the adjacent lateral incisors. other authors found greater pocket depths on adjacent lateral incisors distolingually and on first premolars mesiolingually. in contrast to our study, quirynen et al found no differences between test and control sides. analyzing the initial vertical and mesiodistal localization of the impacted canine and its influence on pocket depth, we found that pocket depth at the incisor dpp was greater (2.93 0.91 mm) in the group of impacted canines with initial vertical position v2 than in the group with initial vertical position v1 (2.33 1.13 mm; p < .05). this suggests that the periodontal tissue of the adjacent teeth undergoes increased stress during canine extrusion. the horizontal position of the impacted canine was also found to affect pocket depth when the groups of canines located in sectors h1 and h2 were compared. pocket depths in group h2 were greater at the incisor mlp and premolar mlp, the lp, and the dlp than in group h1. we found pocket depth differences between teeth adjacent to the impacted canine. other authors have made similar observations. this suggests that surgical-orthodontic treatment mainly influences adjacent teeth, which are exposed to larger intrusive forces and root torque during extrusion, distal movement, and alignment of the impacted canine. differences in pocket depth at the canine mpp may be explained by lack of root torque on the canine during correction of its position from the palatal position.","{'answer_start': [536], 'text': ['surgical-orthodontic treatment affected pocket depth at the mpp on the impacted canine, which was greater (3.1 1.0 mm) than on the control canines (2.4 0.6 mm; p < .01)']}",,clinical,"{'authors': ['Egle Zasciurinskiene', 'Krister Bjerklin', 'Dalia Smailiene', 'Antanas Sidlauskas', 'Algirdas Puisys'], 'doi': 'https://doi.org/10.2319/010907-8.1', 'meta': 'Angle Orthod (2008) 78 (2): 275–280.', 'title': 'Initial Vertical and Horizontal Position of Palatally Impacted Maxillary Canine and Effect on Periodontal Status Following Surgical-Orthodontic Treatment'}",fc86bb62-75c6-40e1-9de3-f557024888bd
"regarding subjects with class ii division 2 (class ii/2) malocclusion, how does the mandibular plane angle compare to subjects with class ii division 1 (class ii/1) malocclusion?","the mean mm angle in class ii/1 was significantly increased with a wide range of vertical skeletal patterns. this finding was in agreement with several studies. in class ii/2, the mm angle was significantly reduced compared with class i. more than 35% of individuals had a reduced mm angle. previous studies reported that class ii/2 is usually associated with a reduced anterior facial height and a horizontal growth vector, which are indications of an anterior growth rotation and a skeletal deep bite in these individuals. when the other vertical parameters between group 1 and group 2 were compared, the posterior to anterior lower facial height ratio was significantly higher in the class ii/2 group compared with that of the class ii/1 group. a review of the literature reveals wide agreement with this finding. the gonial angle is highly correlated with the mm angle. the results of our study were in agreement with blair who found a more acute gonial angle in class ii/2 in comparison with class ii/1, indicating a more flat mandibular plane in individuals with class ii/2. the saddle angle was more obtuse in group 1 compared with group 2. a more obtuse angle may be indicative of a more severe class ii skeletal pattern. there is a general agreement in the literature on the dentoalveolar cephalometric characteristics of class ii/1 and ii/2 malocclusions. as expected, and according to the definitions and angle's original description of class ii/2 malocclusion, compared to class ii/1, the upper incisors are more retroclined in class ii/2. the lower incisors were proclined in group 1. a high percentage of subjects (47%) had proclined lower incisors. the incisor proclination might be attributed to dentoalveolar compensation in response to mandibular retrusion. on the other hand, a few previous studies reported a normal inclination of the mandibular incisors in class ii/1. in class ii/2, the lower incisors exhibited a normal inclination to the mandibular plane. some studies reported similar results. a high percentage (45%) of individuals in the class ii/2 group had a normal inclination of lower incisors to the mandibular plane, about one third of subjects had them retroclined, and less than one quarter of them had proclined lower incisors. the interincisal angle was significantly increased in most of the subjects in the class ii/2 group. this is in agreement with previous studies which described an obtuse interincisal angle in class ii/2 individuals due to the retroclined upper incisors. in class ii/1, the interincisal angle was significantly reduced in most of the subjects due to the proclined upper and lower incisors in this malocclusion, a finding that agrees with previous studies. all results in this study that contradict results of some previous studies might be attributed to ethnic background, age, and size of the studied sample or due to the use of different reference lines.","{'answer_start': [1020], 'text': ['a more flat mandibular plane in individuals with class ii/2']}",,anatomy,"{'authors': ['Emad A.

"in orthodontics, how can we define the process of diagnosis?","orthodontic diagnosis may be defined as the process of determining by examination the nature and circumstances of dentofacial imbalance. the decision reached from such an examination will dictate the plan of corrective therapy to be initiated within the possibilities of orthodontic treatment and related clinical sciences. in order to diagnose the nature of dentofacial imbalance for the individual patient, a range for acceptable dentofacial balance must be established. the definition of this acceptable range of variation is the basis for many of the differences of opinion that exist today. it is now generally accepted that individual variation is the rule, but how far this variation may deviate from hypothetical norms is the cause of much disagreement. an orthodontic diagnosis is futile without the application of successful orthodontic corrective measures, a sound orthodontic diagnosis application of corrective therapy presupposes a thorough knowledge of normal and abnormal growth and development of the dentofacial complex, as well as an awareness of the possibilities and limitations of the various therapeutic orthodontic procedures. this knowledge forms a basis for developing sound orthodontic treatment objectives. angle proposed the first clear-cut objectives for orthodontic therapy when he defined the line of occlusion and presented a classification of malocclusion based upon the relationship of the first permanent molars, these objectives were immediately adopted by the profession and provided a goal generally applicable for orthodontic therapy. with the subsequent refinement and increased efficiency of orthodontic appliances, and the development of other diagnostic criteria, more sophisticated objectives were sought by the profession.","{'answer_start': [40], 'text': ['the process of determining by examination the nature and circumstances of dentofacial imbalance']}",,clinical,"{'authors': ['Alton W.

"regarding the stability of orthodontic mini-implants, what is the issue with high insertion torque?","according to the pilot cbct study, the minimum average buccal bone thickness of 2.3 mm was discovered, and the length was shortened from 2.6 mm (n1) to 2 mm (n2) to be embedded exclusively in the bone superficial to tooth surfaces. design revisions of shortened length, decreased diameter, and tapered interior successfully reduced excessive insertion torque of n1. the tapered and hollow interior of n2 likely diminished bone friction experienced during placement of n1 and thus further decreased insertion torque. an insertion torque range of 3. to 14.65 ncm without implant breakage and bone fracture was identified, and n2's mean mit was within this physiologic limit, while n1's mean mit exceeded this range. insertion torque needs to be balanced as high insertion torque was found to cause tensile and compressive stress to both cortical and cancellous bone tissue, and excessive stress could cause irreversible damage to the bone. on the other hand, very low tensile stress during placement can be insufficient to properly stimulate bone repair. n1 showed greater mit and mrt than n2 consistent with previously reported positive correlation between diameter and torque values. in contrast, n2 required the greatest force to displace all three distances of 0.01, 0.02, and 0.03 mm in the lateral displacement test. this discrepancy in stability hierarchy may contribute to the microcracks introduced during the placement of n1 with high mit. the study by lee and baek highlighted the increase in microdamage, such as the number of cracks, crack length, and crack radius, with the greater diameter but not with the added tapering of mini-implants. similarly, n1's large diameter led to compromised mechanical stability by generating microdamage to the surrounding bone, while n2's tapering enhanced stability without the increase in microdamage. in addition, tr indicates mechanical efficiency of easy placement but relatively more difficult removal. compared with n1, n2 experienced a considerable reduction in mit (by 40%) as desired but not as much reduction in mrt (by 20%). therefore, tr of n2 was significantly higher than n1 and ca. in mini-implant assisted orthodontics, high torque ratio of n2 design can be a more valuable mechanical property than individual torque values.","{'answer_start': [755], 'text': ['high insertion torque was found to cause tensile and compressive stress to both cortical and cancellous bone tissue, and excessive stress could cause irreversible damage to the bone']}",,clinical,"{'authors': ['Christine Hong', 'Peter Truong', 'Ha Na Song', 'Benjamin M.

"regarding arch perimeter, how much space is produced by 1 mm of expansion at the premolars?","krieger et al. reported that 58% of patients had lower incisor crowding resolved with a combination of ipr and incisor protrusion, but they did not report on incisor proclination, with protrusion referring to the anterior movement of the incisal edge. kravitz et al. found that predictability of tooth movement when resolving <5 mm of crowding or spacing with incisor protrusion was only 41%. cephalometric evaluation increases the accuracy of measuring the proclination and protrusion of incisors; however, consideration must be made when planning treatment for protrusion. the most accurate treatment methodology for crowding resolution is to increase the amount of ipr. our study showed that in the mild and moderate crowding groups, aside from overbite and overjet, there were no statistically significant changes between t0 and t1. in the severe crowding group, all of the variables, including lower incisor position and angulation, showed a statistically significant change from t0 to t1. therefore, we can conclude that, in a more severely crowded dentition, the invisalign treatment caused the lower incisor to procline and protrude. our study is the first to report on buccal arch expansion and its relationship to crowding resolution. the results revealed buccal arch expansion played a significant role in crowding management. the mean increase in intermolar width was 1.65 mm in the mild crowding group, 1.86 mm in the moderate group, and 2.65 mm in the severe group. interpremolar widths increased 1.57 mm, 2.52 mm, and 3.19 mm, respectively, and intercanine widths increased 1.28 mm, 1.77 mm, and 1.74 mm, respectively. it was noted that there was no statistical difference between the three groups in final arch width, suggesting there may be a correlation between crowding and pretreatment arch width. ricketts et al. calculated a formula between arch width and arch perimeter and reported that for every 1 mm of molar expansion, 0.25 mm of space is produced, and for every 1 mm of premolar expansion, 0.7 mm of space is created. the inclusion criteria for our study required that ipr be done as programmed by the clincheck software. studies have shown that, even when ipr is completed clinically as prescribed, it might not be accurate. chudasama and sheridan and johner et al. highlighted that the amount of completed ipr achieved was consistently less than prescribed. in our study, when we compared the pretreatment with the posttreatment sum of the mesiodistal tooth widths, we found similar results. when removing the outliers, the percentage of crowding correction with ipr reduced to a mean of 35% between the three groups. of interest when considering ipr is the difference in mean values of ipr in the mild vs severe group of less than 1.0 mm. an increase in crowding did not correlate with a significant increase in ipr (p>.05). our results clearly showed that buccal arch expansion and anterior proclination were the predominate contributors to crowding resolution in the severe crowding cohort. this indicates that if more ipr is prescribed, a reduction in proclination could be expected.","{'answer_start': [2018], 'text': ['0.7 mm of space is created']}",,clinical,"{'authors': ['Laura O Duncan', 'Luis Piedade', 'Milos Lekic', 'Rodrigo S Cunha', 'William A Wiltshire'], 'doi': 'https://doi.org/10.2319/042415-280.1', 'meta': 'Angle Orthod (2016) 86 (4): 577–583.', 'title': 'Changes in mandibular incisor position and arch form resulting from Invisalign correction of the crowded dentition treated nonextraction'}",d43d5442-3d58-4ae0-87da-7b0035561aba
"regarding craniofacial anatomy, which muscles are among the suprahyoid group of muscles?","the maximal emg activity during sleep did not show any significant changes in either the masseter or suprahyoid muscles. however, the maximal emg activity in the suprahyoid muscles tended to decrease after insertion of the bionator (figure 4). while the maximal emg activity of the masseter muscle recorded during sleep was below 100% mvc in all of the subjects, the emg activity of the suprahyoid muscles during sleep exceeded 100% mvc in many subjects. this means that the emg activity recorded during maximal jaw opening during wakefulness was not necessarily the actual maximal activity of the suprahyoid muscles. among the suprahyoid muscles, emg activities of the anterior belly of the digastric, geniohyoid, and mylohyoid muscles could be recorded with surface electrodes attached to the submental region in this study. moreover, this type of surface electrode could also record the emg activity of the genioglossus muscle. in the present study, several suprahyoid muscles were regarded as a single muscle group, and the overall emg activity was recorded without distinction among individual muscles. these muscles are considered to be active during jaw opening, swallowing, and controlling the position of the hyoid bone and tongue posture. therefore, suprahyoid emg activities beyond 100% mvc during sleep were likely to be associated with these behaviors rather than maximal jaw opening. although the number of events beyond 40% mvc per hour did not change significantly in the masseter and suprahyoid muscles, it tended to decrease with a bionator. interestingly, events beyond 40% mvc were recorded in the masseter muscle of all of the subjects, which inferred that all of the subjects performed bruxing during sleep. three subjects were aware of their nocturnal bruxism, however, there was no relationship between the number of bruxing events and awareness of nocturnal bruxism.","{'answer_start': [666], 'text': ['the anterior belly of the digastric, geniohyoid, and mylohyoid muscles']}",,anatomy,"{'authors': ['Shigetoshi Hiyama, DDS, PhD', 'Gen Kuribayashi, DDS', 'Takashi Ono, DDS, PhD', 'Yasuo Ishiwata, DDS, PhD', 'Takayuki Kuroda, DDS, PhD'], 'doi': 'https://doi.org/10.1043/0003-3219(2002)072<0048:NMASMA>2.0.CO;2', 'meta': 'Angle Orthod (2002) 72 (1): 48–54.', 'title': 'Nocturnal Masseter and Suprahyoid Muscle Activity Induced by Wearing a Bionator'}",1c25b484-3c30-47c1-8580-13ddf2114e71
which muscle attaches to the temoporomandibular joint (tmj) disc/sphenoid?,"let us assume, for the moment, that a muscle spasm has developed as a result of an occlusal imbalance and that this spasm is in the temporal muscle. how can it cause a clicking in the temporomandibular joint? to explain this we must first see what occurs in a normal functional situation free from muscle spasms and temporomandibular joint disturbance. in this situation to open the mouth widely, it is necessary for both lateral pterygoid muscles to contract maximally. at the precise moment of maximal contraction the temporal muscles are relaxing and stretching, thus guiding the degree and direction of mandibular motion. in action the lateral pterygoid muscles are antagonists to the temporal muscles, that is, when one group is contracting, the other group is relaxing and vice versa. this is a reciprocal activity made possible through reciprocal innervation. under normal circumstances the timing in reciprocal innervation cise; when one muscle is contracting, its antagonist is relaxing. because our fabric of because our fabric of knowledge is not yet completely woven on what happens in the temporomandibular joint when the temporal muscles are in spasm, we must speculate as to what occurs. again, in order to open the mouth widely, the lateral pterygoid muscles must be in full contraction. however, now the temporal muscle is in a spasm. in this phase of contraction it begins to elevate the mandible before the lateral pterygoid muscles cease contracting. the reciprocal timing preciseness normally existing between these two muscles is lost, and now for a split second both muscles are in a phase of contraction. during this period the articular disc is forward because the superior fibers of the lateral pterygoid muscle which are attached to it by way of the capsule have not had a chance to relax their pull, nor have the inferior fibers had a chance to release their pull on the condyle. at this moment the temporal muscle, which is in spasm, elevates the condyle behind the disc. on this elevation of the mandible a click develops in the joint. subsequently, on opening the jaws, the condyle slides forward onto the disc and another click is heard. it follows then, that a click in the temporomandibular joint on closing and another on opening of the jaws would be symptomatic of a muscle spasm in the temporal muscle. if this uncoordinated, confused struggle continues between the elevator (temporal) and the protrusor (lateral pterygoid) muscles of the mandible for a long period of time, a functional and an anatomical collapse follows in the temporomandibular joint resulting in pain, degenerative changes and an ultimate limitation of function.","{'answer_start': [1686], 'text': ['the superior fibers of the lateral pterygoid muscle']}",,anatomy,"{'authors': ['Joseph R.

what is a class iii canine relationship?,"the means of spacing and crowding ranged from maxillary spacing equivalent to 4/3 incisor width at 3 years of to mandibular crowding equivalent to 1/3 incisor width at 15 years of age. in the maxillary arch the mean spacing decreased from 4/3 incisor width at 3 years to 0 by 14 years of age. after 14 years mean crowding started and increased with age. in the mandibular arch the mean spacing decreased from 4/5 incisor width at 3 years to 0 by 7 years of age. after 7 years mean crowding started and steadily increased to 1/3 incisor width by 15 years. in the maxillary arch at 6 years of age none of the cases had crowding but at 14 years 24% showed crowding. in the mandibular arch from 6 to 14 years of age the crowding increased from 14 to 51% of the cases. examination of the individual series of cases revealed several findings that are of value to the orthodontic profession: (1) crowding of permanent anterior teeth was absent when the total primary anterior spacing was equal to or greater than the width of the permanent mandibular right central incisor; (2) crowding was consistently more pronounced in the mandibular than in the maxillary anterior teeth; (3) of 16 cases having no primary anterior spacing 5 resulted in no crowding of the permanent anterior teeth. in this report occlusion was classified both in the molar and in the canine regions. the angle system of classification was used in the molar region and a so-called angle method was used in the canine region. a class i canine relationship was one in which the cusp point of the maxillary canine fell on a line which bisected the embrasure between the mandibular canine and first premolar. in other words, a class i canine relationship was present when the cusp point of the maxillary canine interdigitated perfectly with the mandibular canine and first premolar. a class ii canine relationship was one in which the cusp point of the maxillary canine was positioned mesial to the midline of the embrasure and a class iii canine relationship was one in which the cusp point of the maxillary canine was positioned distal to the midline of the embrasure between the mandibular canine and first premolar. the observations were graded in terms of quarters of a cusp in both the molar and canine regions. observations were graded in terms of","{'answer_start': [2036], 'text': ['the cusp point of the maxillary canine was positioned distal to the midline of the embrasure between the mandibular canine and first premolar']}",,clinical,"{'authors': ['Gerald V.

"regarding the growth analysis using cephalometric radiographs, what superimposition can be used to assess overall facial growth?","the aim of this study was to investigate whether the position of point a is affected by local bone remodeling associated with proclination of the upper incisors in class ii division 2 malocclusion. point a has different definitions. in this study, downs' definition was used because it is the most commonly used definition during tracing and cephalometric analysis. changes in the position of point a were divided into skeletal changes, which result from movement of the maxilla relative to the anterior cranial base (growth), and local changes, which are caused by local bone remodeling associated with orthodontic proclination of the upper anterior teeth. to study facial growth, proffit suggested that the most useful approach is to superimpose on the sn line, registering the template over the patient's tracing at the nasion rather than the sella if there is a difference in cranial base length. housten found that this line undergoes little change from growth or remodeling after about 6 years of age, when the sphenoethmoidal synchondrosis fuses; he also mentioned that unfortunately, the nasion does not in fact lie on the anterior cranial base but at the outer limit of the frontonasal suture, which does remodel with growth. thus, an incorrect impression of the way the face has grown will be obtained if serial radiographs are related to one another by means of this line with registration at the nasion. he suggested that superimposition on the sn line with registration at the sella usually yields a reliable picture of overall facial growth. in this study, the total change in the position of point a was investigated by superimposing the pretreatment and postproclination cephalograms on the sn line at the sella. from the sn line, horizontal and vertical reference lines were drawn. the horizontal reference line was drawn 7 degrees at the sn line to simulate natural head position, and the vertical reference line was drawn from the sella perpendicular to the horizontal reference line. to differentiate local changes in the position of point a from total changes, superimposition on maxillary structures was performed. unfortunately, the maxilla is subjected to extensive periosteal remodeling, and no really satisfactory stable sites are available for superimposition.","{'answer_start': [1434], 'text': ['superimposition on the sn line with registration at the sella']}",,growth,"{'authors': ['Kazem S.

what are the extrinsic factors that are associated with anterior crowding?,"the evidence suggests that anterior crowding is caused by a number of intrinsic (endogenous or hereditary) and extrinsic (exogenous or environmental) factors. intrinsic factors include an incompatible relationship between arch size and tooth size, tooth position in the arch and differential growth of the maxilla and the mandible. the extrinsic factors include abnormal habits, mutilation of the dentition and abnormal muscular function. it is obvious that, since man is very heterogenous, there will seldom be observed a completely normal occlusion. this may be attested to by the high percentage of malocclusion which is found in contemporary populations. it would seem that the incidence of malocclusion will, in fact, increase because of an increased frequency of admixture and selective pressures which supposedly are acting to reduce the dentition and arch length.","{'answer_start': [362], 'text': ['abnormal habits, mutilation of the dentition and abnormal muscular function']}",,clinical,"{'authors': ['Robert H.

what are the skeletal characteristics associated with class iii malocclusions?,"skeletal class iii malocclusion is usually characterized by a steep mandibular plane angle, obtuse gonial angle, overdeveloped mandible, underdeveloped maxilla, and a small cranial base angle which may displace the glenoid fossa anteriorly to cause a forward positioning of the mandible. these factors are generally thought to contribute to the development of skeletal malocclusion as well as facial deformities, and are believed to originate from genetic and/or environmental factors. the posterior discrepancy is an important etiological factor in the development of a skeletal class hi malocclusion because it affects the occlusal plane. this idea must be amended for an appropriate clinical approach to the treatment of class iii malocclusion. many diagnostic procedures have been proposed for the treatment of skeletal class iii malocclusion. the antero-posterior component of such malocclusion has been amply analyzed and discussed, but information concerning the vertical componentis insufficient. the occlusal plane is the most important component affecting the lower face vertically. the vertical position of the posterior teeth in a class iii malocclusion is not stable during growth and continuous molar eruption occurs not only during growth of the facial structure, but also during the post-pubertal growth in this sense, genetics may not be the sole reason this type of class iii malocclusion develops; rather, the continued eruption of second and third molars in a limited space may be the major contributing factor. a developing class iii malocclusion may be considered an effect of the posterior discrepancy or posterior crowding. when overeruption of the molars occurs, several unfavorable changes take place (figure 1a, b). if the patients growth potential is low, the mandible may rotate backward. consequently, an anterior openbite may be created. however, if the patient has enough growth potential, vertical growth of the condyle is stimulated. then, the mandible rotates forward creating a skeletal class ii malocclusion. in our practice, we use the multiloop edgewise arch-wire (meaw) technique developed by kim to reconstruct the occlusal plane and correct the class iii malocclusion. figure 2 shows the basic force system used. this system typically induces the following changes: 1. the posterior teeth are intruded and uprighted so that the occlusal plane can be reconstructed and the mandible repositioned posteriorly. 2. repositioning of the mandible may prevent overgrowth of the condyles. 3. the maxilla can be protracted downward and related forward.","{'answer_start': [60], 'text': ['a steep mandibular plane angle, obtuse gonial angle, overdeveloped mandible, underdeveloped maxilla, and a small cranial base angle which may displace the glenoid fossa anteriorly to cause a forward positioning of the mandible']}",,clinical,"{'authors': ['Sadao Sato, DDS, DDSc'], 'doi': 'https://doi.org/10.1043/0003-3219(1994)064<0105:CRDCOS>2.0.CO;2', 'meta': 'Angle Orthod (1994) 64 (2): 105–111.', 'title': 'Case Report: Developmental characterization of skeletal Class III malocclusion'}",964db055-710b-49b7-81e9-7f0df66df593

"regarding the correction of class ii molar relationships, what is necessary to achieve molar distalization when using the distal jet appliance?","objective: to analyze the forces and moments acting in the first molar region, induced by the distal jet appliance for maxillary molar distalization. materials and methods: over a working section of 3 mm with reactivation of the loaded spring systems, the force systems of three laboratory-fabricated appliances of identical design were analyzed with a 3d metering device. results: the force systems registered in vitro exhibited complex biomechanics. regular reactivation of the loaded coils resulted in consistent distalizing forces and uprighting moments, in forces and moments toward buccal as well as slightly intrusive forces, and mesial-inwardly rotating moments. in the sagittal dimension, the distal jet appliance allows almost translatory molar distalization. accordingly, applying uprighting activation is not necessary for treatment. because of the application of the force palatal to the center of resistance of the molars, the teeth experience undesired mesial-palatal and distal-facial rotation. conclusions: the distal jet appliance allows almost translatory distal molar movement, and uprighting activation is not necessary for treatment. the force applied palatal to the center of resistance of the molars produces an undesired mesial-palatal and distal-facial rotation. regular intraoral coil spring reactivation is needed. compliance-dependent appliances (headgear, removable plate appliances) were traditionally used for upper molar distalization. for over a decade, various innovative appliances have been described that are worn only intraorally, are placed to remain fixed temporarily, and make treatment success independent of patient compliance. one of these appliances is the distal jet (american orthodontics, sheboygan, wis). the distal jet consists of a bilateral piston and tube arrangement, with the tube embedded in an acrylic nance button in the palate, supported by attachments on the first or second premolars. a bayonet wire is inserted into the lingual sheath of each first molar band and the free end is inserted into the tubes, much like a piston. a nickel-titanium open-coil spring and an activation collar are placed around each tube. compressing the coil spring generates a distally directed force. the activation collar is retracted and the mesial setscrew in each collar is locked onto the tube to maintain the force. the active components have to be placed palatally. ideally, they result in lines of force running close to the center of resistance of the molars. as opposed to the cervical headgear with which molar distalization can be achieved only as a combination of dental crown tipping with subsequent root uprighting, the biomechanics of the appliance should, in theory, allow translatory molar distalization.","{'answer_start': [1289], 'text': ['regular intraoral coil spring reactivation is needed']}",,clinical,"{'authors': ['Gero S.

"regarding craniofacial growth, what are the components of mandibular rotation?","mandibular rotation includes three components: apparent rotation, which describes the angular change in the mandibular plane relative to the anterior cranial base; angular remodeling, which quantifies remodeling changes in the lower mandibular border; and true rotation, which refers to rotation of the mandibular body relative to the anterior cranial base that can be assessed only with the use of stable mandibular reference structures. the mandible undergoes only limited amounts of apparent rotation because larger amounts of true rotation are typically camouflaged by angular remodeling. true mandibular rotation provides important information for an understanding of facial growth changes. it has been related directly to both the direction and the amount of condylar growth, with increasing amounts of true forward rotation associated with greater and more anterior condylar growth. greater true forward rotation has been associated with greater decreases in the gonial angle, more horizontal displacement of the chin, greater increases in posterior facial height, smaller increases in relative anterior facial height, and greater reductions in the anb and mandibular plane angles. true forward rotation also has been associated with bony modeling changes, including increased deposition at the posterior ramus, increased resorption at the posterior lower border of the ramus, and increased deposition at the anterior lower border. increased amounts of true forward rotation also have been related to greater mesial migration of the molars, greater molar than incisor eruption, and greater incisor proclination. depending on the location of the mandible's center of rotation, excessive true forward rotation can give rise to a deep bite malocclusion.","{'answer_start': [47], 'text': ['apparent rotation, which describes the angular change in the mandibular plane relative to the anterior cranial base; angular remodeling, which quantifies remodeling changes in the lower mandibular border; and true rotation, which refers to rotation of the mandibular body relative to the anterior cranial base']}",,growth,"{'authors': ['Malanie K.

"regarding craniofacial growth, what is the process of cranial base formation?","the fgf and msx genes are important for craniofacial development, particularly for the calvaria, as highlighted by the etiologic relationship between mutations of these genes and human craniosynostosis. however, the role of the fgf and msx genes in the ventral part of the cranium, the cranial base, are largely unknown, and this structure is important for coordinated development and growth of craniofacial skeletons. the cranial base, or basicranium, plays a key role in integrated craniofacial development. it is different from the facial bones that are formed through intramembranous ossification. the cranial base is formed through endochondral ossification and, in this process, a cartilage template is formed first and eventually replaced by bone via chondrocyte apoptosis and osteogenic cell migration. well-organized cartilaginous structures analogous to long-bone growth plates, termed synchondroses, are formed among cranial base bones, acting as growth centers in advancing growth. cranial base synchondroses ossify at different growth stages in human beings, and are regulated by a mechanism that, thus far, is not completely understood. the cranial base is a unique structure that differs from other endochondral bones. skeletogenic cells of the cranial base are derived from paraxial somites in the posterior part and from the neural crest in the anterior part. these two different embryologic parts are distinguishable by distinct growth features. the posterior cranial base matures and reaches its final size earlier than the anterior cranial base. however, the anterior cranial base has a more active and more prolonged growth process that lasts to a very late growth stage. this feature is a prerequisite for coordinated craniofacial development and growth. the basicranium also differs from other portions of the endochondral skeleton; to a great extent, the development and growth of the basicranium are under the influence of the brain, and the final shape and size of the basicranium follow that of the brain. cranial base angulation is formed by the relative flexion of its anterior and posterior parts, and is a unique feature of human beings and a reflection of brain evolution. in many human genetic and developmental disorders, the basicranium is also affected. cranial base anomalies have been identified in down syndrome, turner syndrome, craniosynostosis syndromes, cleidocranial dysplasia, and many other pathologic conditions. in some cases, the cranial base anomaly is believed to be the primary cause that leads to the overall abnormal craniofacial development. concurring with this, animal studies provide experimental evidence that cranial base fusion alone accounts for many craniofacial dysmorphic features. although the genetic mechanisms of development and growth are starting to be elucidated in many structures, very little is known regarding these mechanisms in the cranial base. cranial base development might be genetically determined. unique development and growth features also implicate unique signals or signal uniqueness in the regulation of development and growth. deciphering cranial base development through a genetic approach has just started.","{'answer_start': [622], 'text': ['formed through endochondral ossification and, in this process, a cartilage template is formed first and eventually replaced by bone via chondrocyte apoptosis and osteogenic cell migration']}",,growth,"{'authors': ['Xuguang Nie'], 'doi': 'https://doi.org/10.2319/082305-298', 'meta': 'Angle Orthod (2006) 76 (6): 990–995.', 'title': 'Developmentally Regulated Expression of Msx1, Msx2 and Fgfs in the Developing Mouse Cranial Base'}",c6996d82-e6a4-4eb7-8b9d-da04cee5a88f
"for growing class ii patients, which functional appliance is most effective in controlling the vertical dimension the mandibular?","the maxillary length measurement was significantly larger when comparing the herbst and mara groups to the twin block sample at t1. therefore, it can be appreciated as to how much restriction of maxillary growth occurred during treatment with the herbst appliance when compared with the twin block, mara, and control groups. temporary restriction in maxillary growth by the herbst appliance is well documented in multiple investigations. and may be due to the posterior direction of the force generated by the pistons on the maxilla. in addition, the posterior direction of force caused the maxilla to rotate in a clockwise manner, as demonstrated in this study and by von bremen and pancherz. the herbst group also demonstrated the most upper lip retrusion compared with any group after appliance wear, as previously reported by pancherz and anehus-pancherz. the twin block group demonstrated stability of the skeletal changes as exhibited through the decrease in the wits appraisal and the displacement of pogonion in a more anterior position. after appliance therapy, the anb angle decreased ( 0.6 per year), while the snb angle increased (0.9 per year) when compared with the controls. these findings are consistent with multiple studies, which noted the favorable changes in anb. patel et al noted forward movement of b-point and pogonion while baccetti et al found pogonion to move forward 2.5 mm per year with twin block therapy. the twin block group exhibited the best vertical control when compared with all treatment groups, especially taking into account that the mean sn-gogn angle was initially greater in this group at the outset. the twin block also showed clockwise rotation of the occlusal plane after phase ii therapy and the most flaring of the mandibular incisors at the end of treatment. these findings could be explained by the bite block effect of the appliance on the buccal segments and pressure of the lingual acrylic on the lower incisors. possibly, this side effect could have been prevented using a labial bow to support the lower anteriors as designed by mcnamara and brudon. mills and mcculloch reported similar findings. the twin block appliance also decreased the overbite and overjet significantly over the long term when compared with the controls, showing the stability of the treatment effect.","{'answer_start': [103], 'text': ['the twin block']}",,clinical,"{'authors': ['Nicole J.

does orthodontic treatment increase the risk of tmd problems?,"when considering the presence of tmd signs through a clinical examination, differences between groups also were not found. tmj and muscle tenderness to palpation, considered as important signs in epidemiological studies, were used in this study to detect tmd. a comparison of masticatory and cervical muscles and tmj tenderness to palpation in the four groups showed a similarity in the results. however, nielsen et al reported a higher prevalence of muscle tenderness in orthodontically treated subjects. on the other hand, henrikson et al observed an improvement in muscle tenderness in a longitudinal study of patients of class-ii malocclusion when compared with a normal occlusion control group. the possible association between orthodontics and joint noises has been extensively discussed in the literature. joint sounds are more frequent in tmd patients, although also present in an asymptomatic sample. a slightly higher, not significant, prevalence of tmj sounds was found for treated groups in this study. considered in the past as a cardinal sign to indicate for treatment, the presence of this finding in a painless individual is no longer indicative of need for any type of management. the higher recidive indices (return of joint noises after treatment) and the benign natural course of tmj sounds discourage treatment, especially those irreversible ones. joint noises are frequently associated with anterior or anteromedial disk displacement with reduction. these results are only based on clinical evaluation because a gold standard for disk position was not used. when the presence of joint noises was correlated with joint tenderness to palpation, a statistically significant association was found. in the subjects presenting with joint noises, 52% had tenderness, whereas only 18.2% in the subjects without noises had pain. tasaki et al also observed higher levels of pain in individuals with sounds. the improvements in diagnostic procedures, associated with well-controlled clinical trials have highly influenced techniques today. the clinical application of controlled findings seems to be the right way to perform effective and conscientious dentistry. this concept of evidence-based dentistry can be perfectly applied to orthodontics in relation to tmd. orthodontic treatment does not seem to predispose subjects to tmd problems nor is it indicated as an initial therapy for tmd patients.","{'answer_start': [2277], 'text': ['orthodontic treatment does not seem to predispose subjects to tmd problems']}",,clinical,"{'authors': ['Ana Conti, DDS, MS', 'Marcos Freitas, DDS, PhD', 'Paulo Conti, DDS, PhD', 'José Henriques, DDS, PhD', 'Guilherme Janson, DDS, PhD'], 'doi': 'https://doi.org/10.1043/0003-3219(2003)073<0411:RBSASO>2.0.CO;2', 'meta': 'Angle Orthod (2003) 73 (4): 411–417.', 'title': 'Relationship Between Signs and Symptoms of Temporomandibular Disorders and Orthodontic Treatment: A Cross-sectional Study'}",6d759f85-3763-44ac-a5d9-19ae93271c06
"regarding the eruption of the teeth, what is active eruption?","the aim of this report is to describe the histological changes associated with eruption of the teeth. the investigation is based on the study of 47 human jaws ranging in age from birth to 74 years. eruption, in the usual sense, means the movement of the tooth from the moment it emerges through the gingivae until it reaches the occlusal plane. it has been known for a long time that this movement is only a part of the total motion which the teeth undergo during their life span. they move before they come into the place from which they emerge into the oral cavity, and they continue to move after they have reached the occlusal plane. there seems to be justification for defining the term eruption as including all the movements of the teeth preparatory to their appearance in the oral cavity, their emergence into the oral cavity and also their movements after reaching the occlusal plane. in analyzing the relationship of the position of the tooth to the jaw, differentiation between active and passive eruption has been ascertained. active eruption is the drift of the tooth in relation to the jaw. assuming that opposing points were marked on the tooth and on the jaw, it could be observed after some time that the two points had moved apart. passive eruption is the shifting of the epithelial attachment in an apical direction, recession of the gum. both processes, active and passive eruption, are continuous, presumably, throughout the entire life of the tooth. for the present discussion and for a better understanding it is advisable to separate these phenomena. our investigation is concerned only with the active eruption of the tooth.","{'answer_start': [1058], 'text': ['the drift of the tooth in relation to the jaw']}",,clinical,"{'authors': ['Joseph P.

"with regards to the soft tissue profile, what is the normal range for the nasolabial angle?","pretreatment values were compared with posttreatment values in order to evaluate the esthetic consequences of the changes produced on the descriptive statistics for the changes between posttreatment and pretreatment soft-tissue profile. this was done using scattergrams where both values are reflected for each variable and each patient, with pretreatment values on the x axis and posttreatment values on the y axis. standards of acceptable facial esthetics that, if possible, do not change with age, are necessary before conclusions can be drawn. as the e-line from ricketts shows a variable behavior with respect to the soft-tissue profile through time, and standards for the labiomental angle are not yet well established, only the following changes will be analyzed: a) the nasolabial angle b) protrusion of upper and lower lip to the sn-pg line c) depth of the sulcus superior, and d) the relationships of the soft-tissue line tot the h-line. following drobocky and smith the normal range for the nasolabial angle will between 90 to 120, with a desirable value of approximately 100 to 105. burstone established a normal protrusion of the upper lip to the sn-fg line of 3.5 +- 1.4 mm, and a normal protrusion of the lower lip to the sn-p line of 2.2 +- 1.6mm. we will therefore accept a desirable range of upper lip protrusion from +1 to +6 mm, and a desirable range of lower lip protrusion from -0.5 to +5 mm. according to holdaway, the superior sulcus depth (measured to a line perpendicular to frankfort and tangent to the upper lip) has an acceptable range of +1 to +4 mm, with +3 mm being ideal. the measurement of sulcus superior to the h-line has an acceptable range of +3 to+7 mm, with+5 mm being ideal. the distance between the lower lip and the h-line has an acceptable range between -1 and +2 mm, the ideal being between 0 and +0.5 mm. holdaway also specifies that the contour in the inferior sulcus area should fall into harmonious lines with the superior sulcus form, so we will also accept a range of +3 to +7 mm as a normal range of sulcus inferior to the h-line.","{'answer_start': [977], 'text': ['the normal range for the nasolabial angle will between 90 to 120']}",,anatomy,"{'authors': ['Luis Alberto Bravo, MD, DDS, MS, PhD'], 'doi': 'https://doi.org/10.1043/0003-3219(1994)064<0031:STFPCA>2.0.CO;2', 'meta': 'Angle Orthod (1994) 64 (1): 31–42.', 'title': 'Soft tissue facial profile changes after orthodontic treatment with four premolars extracted'}",dcaac64c-88ad-42b2-afdc-fe5b79b62542
"in mixed dentition, in which direction do permanent molars drift?","eruption. since early loss can accelerate or delay eruption of the succedaneous tooth, this can affect eruption, sequence and timing. it will alter position of the permanent tooth but only in a special circumstance: following very early loss of a second primary molar, the permanent first molar may erupt mesially. otherwise, space loss associated with drift is primarily a posteruption phenomenon. drift. early loss leads to vertical drift of the opposing primary tooth and to mesiodistal drift of the permanent molars and incisors; it rarely leads to buccolingual drift of permanent or primary teeth. mesial drift of the permanent molars is a well-recognized phenomenon. it is not well-recognized that (a) mesial or distal drift of primary teeth rarely occurs. if a first primary molar is lost prematurely space loss is unlikely (though possible). when space loss does occur in this circumstance, distal movement of the anterior segment is as likely as mesial movement of the posterior segment. an intact primary second molar or canine, in other words, is in itself a good space maintainer; (b) distal drift of permanent incisors is as much to be expected as mesial drift of molars. early loss of primary canines almost invariably leads to space loss by distal movement of the permanent incisors, not by mesial movement of the primary and permanent molars. equilibrium. only minor equilibrium effects are associated with early loss. forces generated in the periodontal lignament are not affected, but resting tongue and lip pressure may be. the tongue will tend to partially occupy a space in the dental arch and lip posture may be affected by early loss of primary incisors. an altered chewing pattern, to avoid the side where a tooth is missing, may result. there is little or no evidence, however, that these possible changes will influence tooth position significantly.","{'answer_start': [305], 'text': ['mesial']}",,clinical,"{'authors': ['JAMES L.

"regarding embryologic development, what is the cause of a cleft palate?","it might be we!l to outline some of the embryological background to better understand the problem. (fig. 1.) there is a fusion of the globular processes of the median nasal process and the maxillary process to form the upper lip, alveolar process and premaxilla in the normally developing fetus. the palatal processes fuse with each other and the nasal between the eighth and tenth week to form the hard palate. this takes place starting in the anterior region and proceeding posteriorly. cleft lip is the result of failure of union of the maxillary and median nasal processes. according to sicher, a tenuous epithelial fusion doe take place at one stage, but because it is not replaced with mesodermal tissue, it later ruptures. cleft palate results from a lack of fusion of the palatal processes with each other and the nasal septum and may be seen in with single or double cleft lip, or alone. the etiology is unknown. there is some evidence that heredity does play a part. theories of malnutrition, congenital syphylis and migration of tissue all have their adherents and the controversy is considerable. the obscure etiology gives rise to a host of theories on the nature of cleft palate, formed from static clinical observation and often used as the basis of an operative procedure. brophy and logan felt that the maxilla was much broader in cleft palate patients than in normal cases, and that the cleft was failure of union of well developed parts. they accordingly recommended bringing the two segments together early in life. case and kingsley both felt that there was seldom sufficient tissue and that development of bony parts was inhibited. the operative procedure was determined by the selection of one or the other morphological interpretation. brophy adherants crushed fragments together, uniting what they considered normally developed bony segments to prevent atrophy of soft tissue and spreading of the cleft by action of the tongue and pressure of the mandible against the inclined planes of the alveolus. those who felt there was an inherent lack of tissue, relied on such operations as the modified dorrance push-back technique, attempting closure of the palatal cleft by soft tissue only. the approaches are fundamentally different and the controversy still exists. there is more general agreement on cleft lip therapy, with most observers of the opinion that there is adequate tissue for repair. that it is a difficult surgical problem, nevertheless, may be seen in figure 2. a most heroic attempt to conserve all tissues for any passable result is necessary in bilateral clefts. even here, the wide divergence of surgical technique and timing and number of operations leaves more basic problems unanswered.","{'answer_start': [516], 'text': ['failure of union of the maxillary and median nasal processes']}",,pathology,"{'authors': ['Touro M.

"regarding the biomechanics of tooth movement, where is the center of rotation located in a tooth undergoing translation?","in order to translate, other vectors must be added to the force system. two common methods are usually employed. one is to add a coupie or torque and the other is to adjust the dental attachment unit (bracket) by adding additional framework to the system. a couple is defined as two equal and opposite forces acting in the same plane. a couple is also a free vector which means that it causes rotation about the center of resistance regardless of its point of application on a body. torque in an edgewise wire is a common example of this principle. by adding sufficient couple to a force system that is not directed through the center of resistance, a proper ratio between the force and couple can be established to cause translation. pure rotation or tipping occurs when the center of rotation and center of resistance are at the same point. pure translation occurs when the center of rotation is at infinity. pure rotation requires a couple or two opposite and equal forces. pure translation requires a single force acting through the center of resistance or a single force not pure rotation or tipping occurs when through the center of resistance but with a properly balanced couple. a single force not acting through the center of resistance and without a couple creates translation and rotation. the center of resistance translates but, in addition, the body will rotate about the center of resistance. there also occurs an instantaneous center of rotation for the system somewhere between infinity and the center of resistance. this center of rotation is related to the perpendicular distance between the force vector and the center resistance. the framework of the attachment mechanism can be adjusted by extension arms so that when the force is applied, it, in effect, will be traveling through the center of resistance or at any distance from it that is desired. the facebow is a good example of this method. while the framework of the facebow may take on many designs and points of attachment to the tooth, the effect on the dental unit is ultimately only related to the shortest perpendicular distance between the force vector and the center of resistance. fundamental physics teaches that the shortest perpendicular distance between a force vector and the center of resistance of a body determines the center of rotation. figure 5 illustrates these principles as they apply to headgear systems. regardless of the design of the facebow or j hook, the body (tooth) reacts to the force system of the headgear that is computed by figuring the shortest perpendicular distance from the force vector to the center of resistance. this distance dictates how the tooth moves and, more specifically, where the instantaneous center of rotation will be (fig. 6).","{'answer_start': [876], 'text': ['center of rotation is at infinity']}",,biomechanics,"{'authors': ['FRANK W.

"regarding temporomandibular joint (tmj) disorders, how is internal derangement defined?","tn vitro animal and human fetal studies have shown little intrinsic growth potential of secondary condylar cartilage compared with primary cartilage from epiphyseal plates. petrovic and stutzman argued that the functional environment and action of the lateral pterygoid muscle are important in the development of condylar cartilage and, hence, the mandible. independently, this led copray et to conclude that local environmental factors are of importance in considering condylar growth. dolwick defined internal derangement of the temporomandibular joint (tmj) as the abnormal relationship of the articular disc to the condyle, fossa, and articular eminence, with the disc usually displaced in an anteromedial direction. since disc displacement can be seen as a loss of harmony between functional tmj components, it may be considered a local environmental disturbance with the potential to affect condylar development. juvenile rheumatoid arthritis has been shown to have a profound effect on craniofacial growth, presumably by inflammatory destruction of the condylar cartilage. altered condylar morphology or loss of normal shape, as seen on plain film radiography, has been associated with altered craniofacial morphology, although no clear cause-and-effect mechanism was postulated. patients with disc displacement without reduction show osseous changes of the condylar head, but these changes are found less frequently in patients with disc displacement with reduction. a strong relationship between disc perforation and degenerative joint disease of the temporomandibular joints has been shown, whereas the relationship between internal derangement and degenerative joint disease is less evident. internal derangement represents a less violent change in the local environment. nevertheless, disc displacement pulls the retrodiscal tissue forward between the condyle and articular eminence, with potentially harmful effects. compression of this normally vascular tissue may occur, altering oxygenation, nutrition, and lubrication of condylar tissue through synovial fluid changes. these localized changes may be adequate to alter the dynamic growth within this region, resulting in a loss of facial growth equilibrium expressed in the various adaptive growth sites. the aim of this study was to determine whether temporomandibular disc displacement is associated with specific craniofacial characteristics.","{'answer_start': [564], 'text': ['the abnormal relationship of the articular disc to the condyle, fossa, and articular eminence, with the disc usually displaced in an anteromedial direction']}",,pathology,"{'authors': ['B.

what is the goal of premolar extractions in orthodontics?,"the appropriate therapy for dental crowding varies according to the magnitude of the problem. according to little et al., this therapy may involve follow-up to develop and correct the occlusion. however, this is not always the case, and correction may occur spontaneously in patients with slight crowding (up to 2 mm); cases of severe crowding (>9 mm) may require more extensive therapy with tooth extractions. severe crowding caused by tooth size arch length deficiency (tsald) may be treated at an early stage with serial tooth extractions in the early mixed dentition (first transitory period) or with late extraction of the premolars in the permanent dentition. the classic procedure of early treatment with the protocol of serial extractions has involved removal of the primary canines and finally; followed by later removal of the permanent the first premolars. therefore, the goal of extraction in both time intervals is to create space to enable the correct alignment and leveling of the teeth in basal bone. the ideal time for the beginning of orthodontic treatment has always been a subject of controversy; the factors that most frequently favor early treatment are that it is easy to perform, and its cost, duration, and stability are better vs late treatment. this was also the opinion of 159 orthodontists of the american board of orthodontics, who said that treatment performed at an early stage enables improved control of growth; increases the patient's self-esteem and parents' satisfaction; presents better and more stable results; diminishes the extent of treatment needed for the permanent dentition, when necessary; and causes less damage to the periodontal tissues and tooth enamel. many authors have written about the subject expressing the same optimistic trend toward early treatment with regard to clinical efficacy, reduction in mechanotherapy, and increase in stability. however, their affirmations were based on professional experience and case reports only. therefore, by means of a systematic review, the aim of this research was to answer the following focused question: for patients with severe crowding caused by tsald, are the occlusal and secondary outcomes of treatment with early first premolar extraction equivalent to those obtained with late treatment?","{'answer_start': [928], 'text': ['to create space to enable the correct alignment and leveling of the teeth in basal bone']}",,clinical,"{'authors': ['Hibernon Lopes Filho', 'Lúcio H.

what is the goal of orthodontic treatment?,"the mission of orthodontics would be to assure that all individuals reach their maximum dental potential. this new definition would not imply that all developing occlusal disharmonies would require corrective treatment. it would free us from the rigid angle paradigm and would allow us to evolve into a modern health specialty. we could abandon the either-or, all or none kind of treatment philosophy that we currently adhere to. if we recognized faulty occlusion on a continuum with normal occlusion, we could think in terms of not correcting some problems at all or correcting certain handicapping problems only to the degree that would bring them within acceptable limits. this position would force us to re-examine the issue of the benefits of early treatment. our goal would be to achieve functional occlusion, acceptable dentofacial esthetics and self-image, and reasonable denture stability for everyone. one might ask how we could define the terms functional, acceptable and reasonable. orthodontists in the past have learned to agree with great reliability on less well-defined objectives than these. it may be that we would simply have to agree to certain conventions and adopt them. george moore was criticized for making similar recommendations twenty-five years ago. it was claimed that broadening our definition of orthodontics would lower our standards. this is not true biologically or mechanistically and it certainly is not true humanistically. from a public health point of view, it would raise our standards tremendously if our services reached more people, the way one maintains standards is by designing a system that is enforceable. in our university programs, how many of us have instituted a system of peer review for our post-graduate students?","{'answer_start': [783], 'text': ['to achieve functional occlusion, acceptable dentofacial esthetics and self-image, and reasonable denture stability for everyone']}",,clinical,"{'authors': ['J.

"regarding the biomechanics of tooth movement, how can we compute the magnitude of the moment of a couple?","orthodontic tooth movements are currently described using biomechanical newtonian mathematical models which explain tooth movement from a pure physics point of view where only two possible ways exist to apply a force system to a tooth. the first is by a single force, which in practice almost never acts through the center of resistance. therefore, a single force results in displacement of the center of resistance in the direction of the line of the force and tipping as shown in figure 1. this tendency for rotation is called the moment of the force whose magnitude is equal to the magnitude of the force multiplied by its perpendicular distance from the center of resistance of the tooth. this endows the moment of the force with a clockwise or counter-clockwise sense (direction) around a center of rotation which will always be apical to the center of resistance of the tooth. the second method by which tooth movement can be effected is through the application of a pair of equal forces which are parallel, noncolinear, and of opposite direction, termed a couple (figure 2). this system, applied anywhere on a tooth, creates only a tendency for rotation referred to as the moment of the couple whose magnitude is equal to one of the forces of the couple multiplied by the inter-force distance. the center of rotation resulting from the moment of the couple is always coincident with the center of resistance of the tooth irrespective of its point of application. connoting teeth as rigid and accepting the limitation that orthodontic forces do not act directly through the center of resistance, all appliance systems must cause tooth movement through one of these two processes, either alone or in combination. the traditional paradigm describes tooth movement as rotational (tipping) and/or translational (bodily movement), as shown in figures 1 and 3. figure 1 depicts the effect of a single force whose point of application is away from the center of resistance. this configuration causes rotation or tipping, with the center of resistance moving parallel to the line of force. the latter descriptor of tooth movement, that of translation, more complex (figure 3). here, as with rotation, the force is applied away from the center of resistance, again causing rotation or tipping. however, for to occur there must concurrently exist a couple with an opposite sense tending to tip the root in the opposite direction as the crown. under these conditions, the relative amount of crown tipping (moment of the force) and root tipping (moment of the couple) expressed at any given moment in time determines the location of an instantaneous center of rotation. when these two oppositely directed moments are equal in magnitude, the center of rotation is at infinity and tooth translation occurs (figure 3). this determinant is also expressed as the moment to force ratio.","{'answer_start': [1229], 'text': ['one of the forces of the couple multiplied by the inter-force distance']}",,biomechanics,"{'authors': ['Robert J.

"regarding stainless steel alloys, when is an alloy considered stainless?","with the advent of stainless steels in world war i and the refinement of drawing processes to form wires in the late 1930s, gold archwires gradually lost favor to the smaller cross-sectional areas that stainless steel archwires could provide. by the 1950s the type 300 series of stainless steel alloys were used for most orthodontic materials. these typically contained 17 to 25% chromium and 8 to 25% nickel, with the balance being iron. when at least 10 to 13% chromium was present in the alloy, a coherent oxide layer formed that passivated the surface, thereby rendering the alloy stainless. when at least 8% nickel was present, the single phase structure of austenite was stabilized, and the overall corrosion resistance was enhanced. carbon content was purposely maintained below 0.20% to reduce the formation of chromium carbides (figure 1), structures that can ultimately foster the corrosion of austenitic steels. stainless steels were strong, typically about five times stronger than structural girders, and their stiffnesses were 93 to 100% that of conventional carbon steels. these stainless steels were also sensitive to the products of incomplete combustion, such as those found in a sooty flame, and could not be cooled slowly through the temperature regime of 425 to 815c or else sensitization to corrosion could occur. (to convert c to f, multiply by 1.8 and add 32.) as the came to a close, rocky mountain orthodontics was offering two tempers of cold-worked stainless steels: a standard and an extra hard grade. today, american orthodontics advertises three grades of stainless steel wire: a standard, a gold tone, and a super gold tone. stainless steel, however, was not destined to enjoy the predominance in the marketplace that gold had enjoyed for so many years before.","{'answer_start': [439], 'text': ['when at least 10 to 13% chromium was present in the alloy']}",,materials,"{'authors': ['Robert P.

"in mixed dentition, which situation may cause mesial eruption of the first permanent molar?","eruption. since early loss can accelerate or delay eruption of the succedaneous tooth, this can affect eruption, sequence and timing. it will alter position of the permanent tooth but only in a special circumstance: following very early loss of a second primary molar, the permanent first molar may erupt mesially. otherwise, space loss associated with drift is primarily a posteruption phenomenon. drift. early loss leads to vertical drift of the opposing primary tooth and to mesiodistal drift of the permanent molars and incisors; it rarely leads to buccolingual drift of permanent or primary teeth. mesial drift of the permanent molars is a well-recognized phenomenon. it is not well-recognized that (a) mesial or distal drift of primary teeth rarely occurs. if a first primary molar is lost prematurely space loss is unlikely (though possible). when space loss does occur in this circumstance, distal movement of the anterior segment is as likely as mesial movement of the posterior segment. an intact primary second molar or canine, in other words, is in itself a good space maintainer; (b) distal drift of permanent incisors is as much to be expected as mesial drift of molars. early loss of primary canines almost invariably leads to space loss by distal movement of the permanent incisors, not by mesial movement of the primary and permanent molars. equilibrium. only minor equilibrium effects are associated with early loss. forces generated in the periodontal lignament are not affected, but resting tongue and lip pressure may be. the tongue will tend to partially occupy a space in the dental arch and lip posture may be affected by early loss of primary incisors. an altered chewing pattern, to avoid the side where a tooth is missing, may result. there is little or no evidence, however, that these possible changes will influence tooth position significantly.","{'answer_start': [226], 'text': ['very early loss of a second primary molar']}",,clinical,"{'authors': ['JAMES L.

"during intermediate stages of treatment, why are beta-titanium (tma) wires advantageous?","having summarized the state of the art of archwires over the last 50 years, lets explore how they complement and supplement one another in everyday practice by applying the concepts of elastic property ratios. in this regard, some reference to the strength, stiffness, and range would be appropriate as a function of the different stages of treatment (figure 8). during the initial stage of treatment, where initial leveling and alignment are desired, great range and light forces are sought. by referencing elastic property ratios of strength, stiffness, and range, two principal types of wires are suggested: either a multistranded stainless steel wire or a nitinol-type wire. the former capitalizes on conventional variable cross-section orthodontics, which was tabulated many years ago in an orthodontic textbook by dr. raymond thurow. the latter makes use of variable modulus orthodontics in which three of the four principal alloys in use today have different stiffnesses for the same shape and size of archwire. as treatment progresses into the intermediate stage, beta-titanium alloys become advantageous as their formability, springback, range, and modest forces per unit deactivation become favorable. larger sizes of nitinol can still be useful here, however, if an 0.022 inch slot is employed. if sliding mechanics are required, undersized stainless steel wires may be used. as the orthodontic patient progresses to the final stage of treatment wherein more arch, stability and small tooth movements are required, wires having substantial stiffnesses but limited ranges are acceptable. consequently, large gauges of beta-titanium or stainless steel wires may be used to maintain arch form while making small rotational, translational, or tipping motions. exactly which alloy is used here depends on the details of the case that is, whether it is more important to have more range, as afforded by a beta-titanium wire, or more stiffness, as afforded by a stainless steel wire.","{'answer_start': [1116], 'text': ['their formability, springback, range, and modest forces per unit deactivation become favorable']}",,materials,"{'authors': ['Robert P.

"in mixed dentition, what is the objective of a lingual arch appliance?","the sample consisted of 25 early mixed dentition patients (8 males and 17 females) from the office of drs. arthur and steven dugoni. thirteen patients were class i and 12 were class ii (table 1a). these cases exhibited inadequate pretreatment mandibular arch length. the mixed dentition treatment was designed to preserve leeway space with a removable passive lingual arch. all cases had a maxillary 2 x 4 appliance consisting of bands or brackets on the first permanent molars and incisors and a continuous archwire. the 2 x 4 appliance was in place for approximately 12 to 18 months. class ii cases involved headgear therapy to the maxillary arch. the lower first primary molars had been extracted in most cases to encourage distal drifting of the primary and permanent canines and to allow space for unraveling of the lower incisors. at a later stage, some cases had lower second primary molars removed if the first premolars and canines erupted into a crowded position. the treatment goals of early orthodontic treatment (phase 1) were to eliminate or significantly reduce the extent of treatment needed in the permanent dentition. the lingual arch appliance used was a removable, pre-formed .030 stainless steel wire (unitek, monrovia, calif) with an adjustment loop. the wire was inserted into horizontal sheaths on the lower first permanent molars. it was constructed to rest at the contact sample characteristics age (years, months) points (incisal third) of the lower incisors. the lingual arch was typically adjusted monthly during the first 6 months of treatment until there was good alignment of the incisors with the lingual arch contacting the incisal third of all the lower incisors. in a severely crowded case (e.g. patient #10) the lingual arch would initially contact only the most lingually positioned tooth with a light anterior and inferior pressure. in these cases the lingual arch would be adjusted monthly by opening the adjustment loop to move the most lingual tooth labially to the position of the other lower incisors. in most cases there was no attempt to advance all of the incisors forward, tip the lower first molars back, or expand the dentition. the lingual arch was left in place until the canines and premolars erupted. a maxillary retainer was worn for 5 to 10 years after phase 1 treatment. patients in this sample did not receive any edgewise orthodontic treatment in the permanent dentition. these cases were either deemed to have an acceptable occlusion in the permanent dentition or the parents decided not to pursue a second phase of treatment. in most cases the lingual arch was removed and a lower fixed canine-to-canine retainer was placed. this retainer was usually removed after the extraction of the third molars. posttreatment records were taken a minimum of 5 years after removal of the mandibular retention appliances. sixteen patients received sulcus slice (circumferential supracrestal fiberotomy) and 18 had stripping (interproximal enamel reduction) following removal of the lower fixed canine-to-canine retainer.","{'answer_start': [313], 'text': ['preserve leeway space']}",,clinical,"{'authors': ['Steven A.

which malocclusion is a possible autosomal dominant genetic trait?,"within the skeletal and dental pattern identified in this study as characteristic for ii/2 cover-bite are at least three hard-tissue anatomic features with generally accepted hereditary bases: small tooth size, abundant mandibular basal growth and strong chin. familial occurrence of ii/2 cover-bite has been documented in several published reports, including twin and triplet studies by kloeppel, markovic, and orthers and family pedigrees from korkhaus, rubbrecht and trauner. our examination of these published family pedigrees of ii/2 cover-bite points to incontestable genetic influence, probably of an autosomal dominant type with incomplete penetrance, as a significant factor in the formation and expression of angles ii/2 deep-bite or cover-bite malocclusion. inheritance of a complex occlusal variation such as ii/2 deepbite malocclusion may actually be polygenic and additive in nature, through combined expression of genetically determined anatomical components, rather than being the effect of a single controlling gene for the entire occlusal malformation. angles ii/2 malocclusion, at least in its cover-bite phenotype, is one of a small but growing group of dentofacial abnormalities that show evidence of substantial genetic influence in their origin. although recent heritability studies have been unable to identify specific aspects of genetic influence in occlusal variability, we estimate that 10% to 15% of patients in orthodontic treatment possess genetically determined anomalies resulting in malocclusion. these gene-controlled abnormalities are sometimes found occurring in combinations (although such patients can usually be classified as nonsyndromic) and at present they include hypodontia, infraocclusion, ectopic mesial eruption of first molars, maxillary lateral incisor peg-shape anomaly, palatally displaced canine anomaly, certain tooth transpositions, and class iii skeletal discrepancy, in addition to ii/2 deep-bite malocclusion.","{'answer_start': [719], 'text': ['angles ii/2 deep-bite or cover-bite malocclusion']}",,pathology,"{'authors': ['Sheldon Peck, DDS, MScD', 'Leena Peck, DMD, MSD', 'Matti Kataja, PhD'], 'doi': 'https://doi.org/10.1043/0003-3219(1998)068<0009:CIDMAH>2.3.CO;2', 'meta': 'Angle Orthod (1998) 68 (1): 9–20.', 'title': 'Class II Division 2 malocclusion: A heritable pattern of small teeth in well-developed jaws'}",3e498793-3e54-4bde-a55b-270e4c165a64
"regarding post-orthodontic relapse after retention, does arch expansion or constriction affect crowding after retention?","little, wallen, and riedel studied the stability of mandibular anterior alignment in cases treated with traditional edgewise appliances and first premolar extraction. their 10-year follow-up study found that long-term alignment was variable and unpredictable and that the success of maintaining satisfactory anterior alignment is less than 30%. arch length and width typically decreased during retention, whereas crowding increased regardless of treatment expansion or constriction. little, riedel and artun re-evaluated these cases with 20-year follow-up postretention records and found that crowding continued to increase during the 10 to 20 years postretention phase, but to a lesser extent than during the first 10 years postretention. only 10% of the 20-year postretention cases had clinically acceptable mandibular alignment. mcreynolds and little examined postretention stability of cases treated with edgewise appliances and mandibular second premolar extractions. they found that arch length and width decreased with time and incisor irregularity increased throughout the postretention period. little, riedel, and engst examined postretention stability following first premolar serial extraction and found clinically unsatisfactory mandibular anterior alignment in 73% of the cases and decreases in intercanine width and arch length in 29 of 30 cases. in their paper evaluating stability with mandibular incisor extraction, riedel, little, and bui showed that 29% of single-incisor extraction cases and 56% of the two-incisor extraction cases demonstrated unacceptable mandibular incisor alignment in the postretention stage. these results were considered more favorable than the results of the premolar extraction cases.","{'answer_start': [413], 'text': ['crowding increased regardless of treatment expansion or constriction']}",,clinical,"{'authors': ['Steven A.

is there a difference in the hardness of titanium brackets compared to stainless steel brackets?,"studies suggest that the currently recommended dosage of fluoride tablets needs to be further reduced in certain areas if dental fluorosis in children is to be avoided. adult orthodontic patients with furcation defects are difficult to treat. typically, furcation defects get worse during orthodontic treatment. it is difficult to keep the area of the furcation clean when the surrounding teeth have bands or brackets. in recent years polytetrafluorethylene membranes have beer very effective for regenerating bone in furcation defects. however, this type of membrane be removed. now, however, bioresorbable membranes have been developed. are these effective for the regeneration of bone in furcatior defects? this question was answered in a study published in the journal of periodontology (1996:67;641-649). in this investigation, 31 patients with class ii furcations were evaluated. ir each of these defects, a bioresorbable membrane consisting of polyglycolic acid and polylactic acid was used. follow-up probing measurements of the furcations were made at 6 months and 1 year. in all cases, the bioresorbable membranes showed clinically and statistically significant improvements in probing depth and clinical attachment level. in the future, bioresorbable membranes will probably become a standard of care for treating furcation defects in adult orthodontic patients. some orthodontic patients are allergic to metals. as a result, alternative types of brackets or attachments must be placed on the teeth. in the past, the only other choice for a bracket would be ceramic or plastic. recently, however, manufacturers have been experimenting with titanium brackets that are produced by metal injection molding of titanium. the production of the bracket involves mixing titanium powder with a binding material consisting of thermoplastic, wax, and plasticizer. this material can be injection molded under significant pressure. after the binder is removed, the bracket is sintered at high temperature in a vacuum. but are these effective, and are they strong enough? these questions were answered in a study published in the journal of dental research (1996:75;1491-1496). in this investigation, titanium brackets were bonded to extracted premolars. a testing machine was used to evaluate the hardness of the bracket and the shear strength of the bond to the tooth. the results of this study show that there were no significant differences between the hardness values of the titanium brackets compared with stainless steel brackets. in the future, if patients are allergic to metals, orthodontists may use titanium brackets fabricated by metal injection molding as an alternative.","{'answer_start': [2415], 'text': ['no significant differences between the hardness values of the titanium brackets compared with stainless steel brackets']}",,materials,"{'authors': ['Vincent Kokich, DDS, MSD'], 'doi': 'https://doi.org/10.1043/0003-3219(1997)067<0005:WSNID>2.3.CO;2', 'meta': 'Angle Orthod (1997) 67 (1): 5–6.', 'title': ""What's new in dentistry""}",0a33ab9e-4f98-4ceb-9485-3b089029de3c
"regarding orthodontic treatment, what space-gaining procedure can decrease bolton disharmonies?","with the increased popularity of aligner therapy and its improving effectiveness in contemporary orthodontics, interest in enamel interproximal reduction (ipr) has grown, as it is being considered as one of the major space-gaining orthodontic procedures. the cortical bone represents the limit for orthodontic tooth movement, which should be considered especially during treatment of crowding with proclination and expansion. interproximal reduction increases the amount of space available. it also offers an attractive alternative to dental extractions as the quantity of enamel removed can be calculated to match the amount of space required for the resolution of dental crowding. this methodology is also helpful for decreasing bolton disharmonies in both the anterior region and full arch length. enamel reduction in the premolar and molar area can provide up to 9.8 mm of additional space for the realignment of mandibular teeth. it can also be used to improve occlusal relationships and functionality by preserving the intercanine distance, while leaving the inclination of the incisors unaltered. ipr also reduces black triangles and increases the extension of the contact area, especially in triangular-shaped, periodontally compromised teeth whose interdental papilla level needs improvement. therefore, ipr in adult patients seems to have a positive effect on interradicular bone volume, particularly in the presence of periodontal bone loss. long-term studies on ipr have demonstrated that careful ipr in the anterior region (the most common area of ipr), using an appropriate technique and with excellent hygiene control, can be performed safely with no negative consequences on the teeth. interproximal reduction is considered a safe procedure on the dental pulp for teeth with average dentin thickness. a variety of techniques and products can be used for ipr, including handheld abrasive strips, burs, and contra angle mounted discs. in aligner therapy, the precision of ipr is a crucial part of the whole treatment and is one of the factors that ensures good sequential aligner fit and success of the final result. the correct implementation of the technique is therefore fundamental for precise tooth movement as determined by virtual planning. the programmed ipr (p-ipr) should correspond to what is actually implemented (i-ipr) to achieve the desired alignment with the correct interproximal contacts. p-ipr and i-ipr can be compared using the calculation features included in digital programming software (bolton function).","{'answer_start': [123], 'text': ['enamel interproximal reduction (ipr)']}",,clinical,"{'authors': ['Zamira Kalemaj a', 'Luca Levrini b'], 'doi': 'https://doi.org/10.2319/040920-272.1', 'meta': 'Angle Orthod (2021) 91 (1): 61–66.', 'title': 'Quantitative evaluation of implemented interproximal enamel reduction during aligner therapy:A prospective observational study'}",9de545a1-08c2-40d2-97a1-7556c4e509d0
"if a patient has up to 2 mm of crowding, what is the severity of the crowding?","the appropriate therapy for dental crowding varies according to the magnitude of the problem. according to little et al., this therapy may involve follow-up to develop and correct the occlusion. however, this is not always the case, and correction may occur spontaneously in patients with slight crowding (up to 2 mm); cases of severe crowding (>9 mm) may require more extensive therapy with tooth extractions. severe crowding caused by tooth size arch length deficiency (tsald) may be treated at an early stage with serial tooth extractions in the early mixed dentition (first transitory period) or with late extraction of the premolars in the permanent dentition. the classic procedure of early treatment with the protocol of serial extractions has involved removal of the primary canines and finally; followed by later removal of the permanent the first premolars. therefore, the goal of extraction in both time intervals is to create space to enable the correct alignment and leveling of the teeth in basal bone. the ideal time for the beginning of orthodontic treatment has always been a subject of controversy; the factors that most frequently favor early treatment are that it is easy to perform, and its cost, duration, and stability are better vs late treatment. this was also the opinion of 159 orthodontists of the american board of orthodontics, who said that treatment performed at an early stage enables improved control of growth; increases the patient's self-esteem and parents' satisfaction; presents better and more stable results; diminishes the extent of treatment needed for the permanent dentition, when necessary; and causes less damage to the periodontal tissues and tooth enamel. many authors have written about the subject expressing the same optimistic trend toward early treatment with regard to clinical efficacy, reduction in mechanotherapy, and increase in stability. however, their affirmations were based on professional experience and case reports only. therefore, by means of a systematic review, the aim of this research was to answer the following focused question: for patients with severe crowding caused by tsald, are the occlusal and secondary outcomes of treatment with early first premolar extraction equivalent to those obtained with late treatment?","{'answer_start': [289], 'text': ['slight crowding']}",,clinical,"{'authors': ['Hibernon Lopes Filho', 'Lúcio H.

"if a patient has a retrusive upper lip, how should the upper incisors be moved to improve facial appearance?","for a patient with a large nose and/or a large chin, if the choices are to protract or retract incisors, moving the incisors forward is better, provided doing so does not deepen the labiomental fold excessively (figure 5). ascertaining patient and parent preferences with computer imaging can be helpful in making this determination. (2) severe midface deficiency or mandibular prognathism creates unattractive lip positions and may affect throat form. this unesthetic condition can rarely be corrected with orthodontics alone, even if normal overjet and overbite are established. in this condition, orthodontic camouflage is rarely satisfactory, and orthognathic surgery should be considered as an alternative. (3) moderate mandibular deficiency is often esthetically acceptable. when computer imaging is used to show the change in facial profile that would result from mandibular advancement surgery as a method for correcting a class ii problem, the straighter profile usually looks dramatically better to the orthodontist, but patients and parents often do not agree that there is a significant enhancement in facial appearance. as peck and peck demonstrated some years ago,* lay people often have a different concept of facial esthetics and balance from the orthodontist. at present, this seems to be a major area of difference. (4) an upper lip that inclines backward in relationship to a true vertical line is unesthetic. in this context, on profile view in natural head position, a true vertical line is an imaginary plumb line at the intersection of the philtrum of the lip with the columella of the nose (subnasale). a true vertical line can be established either clinically or on cephalometric radiographs taken in natural head position (determined physiologically by how that individual orients his head), and this is one important reason for use of nhp in cephalometry.*! retracting maxillary incisors reduces the prominence of the upper lip, and an important guideline for orthodontists is that maxillary incisors should not be retracted to the point that the inclination of the upper lip to a true vertical line becomes negative. in a patient who already has a retrusive upper lip, it is better to procline the incisors than retract them further, even if that means orthognathic surgery to correct the malocclusion (see figure 5). the combination of guidelines 3 and 4 poses an uncomfortable orthodontic dilemma: some moderately severe class ii malocclusions may be more esthetic before treatment than after, whether orthognathic surgery to advance the mandible or orthodontic treatment to retract the maxillary incisors is chosen. if this proves to be the case, sharing this information with the patient is an important point of informed consent to treatment. for a patient whose concerns are primarily esthetic, this may mean that no treatment is the best choice.","{'answer_start': [2197], 'text': ['it is better to procline the incisors than retract them further']}",,clinical,"{'authors': ['James L.

"regarding interventions to accelerate orthodontic tooth movement, what is the effect of corticotomy on tooth movement?","the results from two included studies showed consistent results that corticotomy can accelerate orthodontic tooth movement. moreover, both employed reliable methods to measure tooth movement (table 4) and specified and used a similar start time of force applications between two groups (table 2), which would lend more credence to their results since the rates of tooth movement into healed and recent extraction sites are significantly different. moreover, the results showed that corticotomy in conjunction with mini-screws can dramatically augment posterior anchorage, which is of prime importance since effective anchorage would greatly improve orthodontic treatment results. since corticotomy is per se a surgical intervention on alveolar bones, it may have adverse effects on periodontal tissues, which was addressed in gantes et al. but not in iino et al. however, in this systematic review, neither study indicated that corticotomy would damage periodontal health, except that gingival index scores increased in the experimental group in aboul-ela et al. we suggest this may be simply a response of gingiva to alveolar healing, since alveolar healing following surgery takes at least 4 months. thus, dental hygiene should be paid special attention during the healing stage after corticotomy. therefore, we suggest that corticotomy is relatively safe and is an effective intervention to accelerate orthodontic tooth movement. in this systematic review, only accumulative moved distance was evaluated. kim et al. revealed that electrical current was capable of accelerating orthodontic tooth movement. this study employed a reliable method to measure tooth movement (table 4). however, it did not specify the start time of canine retraction after first premolar extraction, which decreases the reliability of the results since canine retraction speed into healed and recent extraction sites differ. moreover, since only females were included in this study, we do not know the intervention effects in males. therefore, regarding unreliable methodology and results, we cannot determine whether electrical current would accelerate orthodontic tooth movement.","{'answer_start': [85], 'text': ['accelerate orthodontic tooth movement']}",,clinical,"{'authors': ['Hu Long', 'Ujjwal Pyakurel', 'Yan Wang', 'Lina Liao', 'Yang Zhou', 'Wenli Lai'], 'doi': 'https://doi.org/10.2319/031512-224.1', 'meta': 'Angle Orthod (2013) 83 (1): 164–171.', 'title': 'Interventions for accelerating orthodontic tooth movement: A systematic review'}",a82179ee-da12-4db5-8b53-ac045ea36a3f
"with regards to orthodontic tooth movement, what is the effect of acetaminophen?","some other controversial conclusions regarding the effect of nsaids on tooth movement have been reported. chumbley and tuncay showed that indomethacin inhibited orthodontic tooth movement. arias and marquez-orozco applied expansion force to upper incisors in rats and reported that aspirin (100 mg/ kg) and ibuprofen (30 mg/kg) diminish the number of osteoclasts and reduce orthodontic tooth movement, whereas, acetaminophen (200 mg/kg) did not affect tooth movement. sandy and harris found that the nsaid flurbiprofen inhibited the appearance of osteoclasts, but had no significant effect on tooth movement. wong et al examined the influence of aspirin (65 mg/kg) on orthodontic tooth movement in guinea pigs and found that aspirin did not significantly inhibit tooth movement. roche et al investigated the effect of acetaminophen (500 mg/kg) on tooth movement in rabbits. no statistically significant differences were found. kehoe et al demonstrated that misoprostol increased tooth movement due to pge1 activity, ibuprofen inhibited tooth movement due to pg inhibition, and acetaminophen had no effect on the tooth movement process. although the effects of nsaids on tooth movement are still controversial, cox-2/pge-2 pathway certainly influences orthodontic tooth movement. cox-2 selective inhibitor such as celecoxib might have a high suppressive effect on the target molecule cox-2, which leads to the suppression of root resorption along with tooth movement.","{'answer_start': [411], 'text': ['acetaminophen (200 mg/kg) did not affect tooth movement']}",,biology,"{'authors': ['Carmen Gonzales', 'Hitoshi Hotokezaka', 'Ken-Ichiro Matsuo', 'Tatsunori Shibazaki', 'Joseph H.

"regarding maxillary le fort i surgery, which factor has been associated with increased incidence of intraoperative unfavorable fracture?","the presence of maxillary third molars influenced the transverse angulation of the posterior vertical cut of le fort i. impacted maxillary third molars have been proposed as a factor in the increased incidence of intraoperative maxillary unfavorable fracture. it has been decided that third molars should be removed before orthognathic surgery at a minimum of 6 months before le fort i osteotomy, because it will take time for the maxillary bone to adequately heal. in this case, the upper second molars were revealed to be ectopically erupted, and we recognized that removal of second molars could be justified with the expectation of their satisfactory replacement by third molars. autotransplantation is one of the options available for the treatment of a missing tooth when a donor tooth is available. the recipient site may be an extraction socket or a surgically prepared site. autotransplantation of a third molar for replacement of the missing teeth is sometimes a suitable alternative to prosthetic treatment. fully developed third molars in this case are potential candidates in the absence of other suitable donor teeth. the success rate has been reported to be excellent if the donor teeth were transplanted before root formation was completed.9 teeth with one-third to three-quarter root formation are most frequently transplanted clinically. on the other hand, it has been reported that autotransplantation is a reliable method with a good prognosis for donor teeth with both open and closed apices if teeth with closed apices are endodontically treated. the denuded root surface was expected to be subject to ankylosis or root resorption because of the lack of periodontal membrane. andreasen concluded that the presence of an intact and viable periodontal ligament (pdl) on the root surface is the most important factor in ensuring healing without resorption. in this case, no signs of ankylosis and resorption were evident after the transplantation. essentially, root canal treatment was employed with calcium hydroxide medication because of its high ph, which provides an antimicrobial effect and stimulates the healing process.","{'answer_start': [120], 'text': ['impacted maxillary third molars']}",,clinical,"{'authors': ['Toru Kitahara', 'Akihiko Nakasima', 'Yuji Shiratsuchi'], 'doi': 'https://doi.org/10.2319/022008-103.1', 'meta': 'Angle Orthod (2009) 79 (2): 401–406.', 'title': 'Orthognathic Treatment with Autotransplantation of Impacted Maxillary Third Molar'}",5566f68d-8878-41bf-b283-a5dbe92a0a2e
"regarding smile esthetics, what is the effect of the size of buccal corridors on smile attractiveness?","no significant difference was shown in the esthetic scores between the male and female raters for both the orthodontists and dental students. moore et al found no significant difference in judging smile esthetics between male and female subjects or between male and female judges. martin et al and gracco et al also reported that rater gender and age were not significant in rating of buccal corridor preferences. in this study, the orthodontists and dental students have similar tendencies in rating the preferences of buccal corridor spaces. parekh et al stated that laypersons and orthodontists have similar preferences when the acceptability of buccal corridors and smile arcs are considered. krishnan et al also indicated that there was no perception difference between dental specialists and laypersons on overall smile evaluation. if the assumption is made that unpleasant smiles are those with esthetic scores ranging from 0 to 50 and that pleasant smiles are those with scores of 51 to 100, both the orthodontists and dental students considered smiles with buccal corridors of less than 10% to be pleasant and smiles with buccal corridors of more than 15% to be unpleasant. overall, both the orthodontists and dental students preferred broader smiles to medium or narrow smiles. hulsey, ritter et al, and roden-johnson et al reported that buccal corridor space was not a critical issue for evaluating smile esthetics. however, parekh et al reported that both laypersons and orthodontists preferred smiles in which the smile arc is parallel to the lower lip and buccal corridors were minimal. moore et al reported that a broader smile was judged by laypersons to be more attractive than a narrow smile. martin et al also indicated that orthodontists and laypeople rated smiles with small buccal corridors as significantly more attractive than those with large buccal corridors. across the country, people appear to prefer less buccal corridor spaces. however, it should be taken into account that there is a substantial variation regarding the preferences of buccal corridor spaces. there is an argument that the impression of smile attractiveness is different when we evaluate it from full-face or mouth view. moore et al stated that the size of buccal corridors influences smile attractiveness when the entire face is taken in context. our study showed that the effects of buccal corridors on smile esthetics could be evaluated from mouth view. both the orthodontists and dental students judged excessive buccal corridors of more than 15% as less attractive, and the median values of the esthetic scores of 10% to 15% buccal corridor for the orthodontists and dental students sharply decreased from 79.8 to 37.3 and from 73.0 to 42.8, respectively. it is interesting to reveal that this 5% difference of 10% to 15% buccal corridor caused a clinically significant change (15% vas difference) in the preference of smile esthetics. although the precise cause of this difference is unclear, the raters might consider a 15% buccal corridor as one of the narrow smiles, which were less attractive. clinicians should keep in mind that a small change in buccal corridor spaces might significantly influence the perception of smile esthetics. we propose this range as a threshold between more and less attractive smiles when evaluating buccal corridors.","{'answer_start': [1790], 'text': ['small buccal corridors as significantly more attractive than those with large buccal corridors']}",,clinical,"{'authors': ['Hideki Ioi', 'Shunsuke Nakata', 'Amy L.

"regarding the prevention of infective endocarditis, what is the recommended regimen for antibiotic prophylaxis by the the american heart association in patients who are not allergic to penicillin?","the american heart association recommended higher doses of penicillin than those used to prevent rheumatic fever for the prevention of dental-induced endocarditis. if oral doses are to be used, it recommended either four doses of 0.25 gm. of penicillin v or four doses of 500,000 units of penicillin g on the day of the dental procedure and an extra dose one hour before the procedure. for two days after the procedure, either 0.25 gms of penicillin v or 500,000 units of penicillin g should be given four times a day. in penicillin-allergic individuals, 250 mg of erythrocin should be substituted for each dose of penicillin. no reference could be found in the literature specifically tailoring antibiotic coverage to the orthodontic heart-damaged patient. the inherent nature of orthodontics is such that a series of monthly visits for up to two years is necessary to complete the case. the question arises whether providing a series of monthly increases in the maintenance dose is desirable or even sufficient since the orthodontic appliances remain active between visits. okell and elliott reported causing transient bacteremia by normal mastication but a study by robinson et al. could demonstrate no streptococcal bacteremia after twenty-seven people had chewed on tough wax for five to ten minutes. diener et al. showed a bacteremia in twenty-two per cent of fifty patients with periodontal disease after chewing five minutes on bubble gum. the implications of these studies are that, if normal mastication can cause a transient bacteremia, possibly the altered periodontium during orthodontic treatment would heighten this effect much like a temporary case of periodontitis.","{'answer_start': [209], 'text': ['either four doses of 0.25 gm. of penicillin v or four doses of 500,000 units of penicillin g on the day of the dental procedure and an extra dose one hour before the procedure. for two days after the procedure, either 0.25 gms of penicillin v or 500,000 units of penicillin g should be given four times a day']}",,pathology,"{'authors': ['THOMAS E.

"regarding children in mixed dentition, when is correction of posterior crossbite recommended?","tooth abrasion can be considered as a physiological condition in the deciduous dentition, with its pattern indicating the functional relationship between the dental arches. the degree of tooth abrasion differs in different populations and ethnic groups in relation to dietary habits. eskimos, north american indians, and greek mountaineers, for instance, showed a great extent of abrasion as a result of coarse and rough food diets. in a swedish population, hugoson et al found that tooth wear was absent or slight in 19% of a sample of 5-year-old children in the primary dentition. madlena and coworkers examined 992 extracted primary teeth from hungarian children by means of a stereomicroscope, and they found tooth wear in more than 75% of the examined teeth. tooth abrasion allows for adequate sliding between the dental arches, which is a necessary condition in order to achieve functionally correct development of the masticatory system. if physiological abrasion doesn't occur, the morphology and position of the teeth in the dental arches can create interference to physiological occlusion. this uncomfortable occlusion can be produced by a series of factors such as long, sharp deciduous canines, and as a result, the mandible may search for a new adaptive position. in the sagittal plane, extensive cuspal abrasion, through the removal of occlusal interferences, permits the mandible to shift in a forward position more easily. in contrast, children without physiological abrasion assume a temporary functional retraction of the mandible during closure due to occlusal interferences usually in the canine region. similarly in the transverse plane, it can be hypothesized that, in the presence of some occlusal interference, the mandible could shift laterally, resulting in a lateral shift with a posterior crossbite occlusion. in fact, several authors observed that forced guidance occurred in most unilateral crossbites. posterior crossbite is a common malocclusion in early stages of development, with prevalence rates ranging from 8% to 16% and with unilateral crossbite considered the most frequent clinical condition. it has been demonstrated that lateral posterior crossbite brings an anomalous chewing pattern in the mixed dentition and that early correction is advisable to minimize future problems. the aim of this study was to evaluate the degree of abrasion in posterior teeth in subjects with unilateral crossbite in the primary dentition in order to investigate the role of tooth wear in association with lateral shift of the mandible and to determine possible occlusal targets for early treatment of the malocclusion.","{'answer_start': [2260], 'text': ['early correction is advisable to minimize future problems']}",,clinical,"{'authors': ['Isabella Tollaro, MD, DDS', 'Efisio Defraia, MD, DDS', 'Andrea Marinelli, DDS, PhD', 'Muhieddin Alarashi, DDS, PhD'], 'doi': 'https://doi.org/10.1043/0003-3219(2002)072<0426:TAIUPC>2.0.CO;2', 'meta': 'Angle Orthod (2002) 72 (5): 426–430.', 'title': 'Tooth Abrasion in Unilateral Posterior Crossbite in the Deciduous Dentition'}",66145bd7-85c9-4c27-9fc6-1e15359768e5
"regarding the epidemiology of syndromes, what is the incidence of turner syndrome","turner syndrome (ts) is an x chromosome abnormality of females, occurring in approximately 1 in 2500 live female births. these patients present with varying degrees of dysmorphic features. virtually all patients develop short stature, and common dysmorphic features include epicanthal folds, low posterior hairline, short webbed neck, and cubitus valgus1 (figure 1). organ system problems include ovarian dysfunction, structural renal abnormalities, and congenital heart malformations, including bicuspid aortic value and coarctation of the aorta.2 comparison of craniofacial proportions with normal children shows retarded development of the cranial skeleton, reduced size of the craniofacial complex, retrognathic profile, and increased incisor overjet. decreased overbite and class ii dental and jaw relationships usually are present, and an increased incidence of anterior open bite and lateral crossbite has been observed. common intraoral findings include posterior crossbite, narrow high-arched palate, early eruption of permanent teeth, reduced tooth size, and an increased tendency toward idiopathic root resorption. loss of all or part of an x chromosome causes turner syndrome. common karyotypes include 45,x, 46x,i(x) and 45,x/mosaic. the 45,x karyotype is the most common, occurring in 50 55% of all cases, with 46x,i(x) karyotype (isochromosome x) occurring in approximately 15% of cases. mosaic subjects have 2 or more separate cell lines, eg, 45,x/46,xx, 45,x/46,xy, or 45,x/47,xxx. the chromosomal basis for most of the phenotypic features of ts is an insufficiency of genes that reside on the x chromosome. in normal 46,xx females, one x chromosome is inactivated shortly after fertilization through the process of lyonization. although one x chromosome is inactivated, some of its genes remain active, including several in the pseudoautosomal region of the short arm. absence of the shox gene, which is expressed at high levels by adult bone marrow and fibroblasts6 and in the limbs and first and second pharyngeal arches during human embryonic development, appears to be responsible for short stature in turner syndrome subjects.","{'answer_start': [77], 'text': ['approximately 1 in 2500 live female births']}",,pathology,"{'authors': ['Andrew D.

what is the purpose of functional appliances?,"the goal of functional appliance therapy is to encourage or to redirect the growth in a favorable direction. several functional appliances are presented in the literature for the correction of class ii division 1 malocclusion. the major differences in the effects between various orthopedic appliances are mainly related to the technique of fabrication, construction bites, and hours of wear. among various removable and fixed functional appliances, the twin-block and herbst appliance, respectively, are most efficient in correcting a class ii malocclusion. moreover, removable appliances are considered uncomfortable and unesthetic by many patients and require patient compliance. consequently, a primary advantage of fixed functional appliances is independence from the need for patient cooperation. for advancement of the mandible along with multibonded fixed appliances, various clinicians have designed many fixed functional appliances. the mandibular protraction appliance (mpa) is a recently developed noncompliant rigid fixed functional appliance that holds the mandible anteriorly and corrects the class ii anteroposterior discrepancy. the mpa-iv is the latest version of an mpa and has many advantages over its three previous versions and also over other fixed functional appliances. although few case reports and a single study are in the literature mentioning the nature of class ii correction with mpa-i, ii, and iii, there is not a single study mentioning the effects of mpa-iv. thus, the present study was designed to evaluate the treatment effects of mpa-iv and to compare its effects with those of one of the most popular removable functional appliances, the twin-block appliance, in the treatment of class ii division 1 malocclusion.","{'answer_start': [47], 'text': ['encourage or to redirect the growth in a favorable direction']}",,growth,"{'authors': ['Ashok Kumar Jena', 'Ritu Duggal'], 'doi': 'https://doi.org/10.2319/062709-359.1', 'meta': 'Angle Orthod (2010) 80 (3): 485–491.', 'title': 'Treatment Effects of Twin-Block and Mandibular Protraction Appliance-IV in the Correction of Class II Malocclusion'}",9c98a9ae-2f2f-4bf7-b574-29e37f32d7d3
"regarding craniofacial growth, what causes counterclockwise rotation of the mandible?","what are these vertical elements of growth? specifically where are the increments which produce an increase in facial height? they are as follows: (fig. 3) (1) growth at nasion and in the corpus of the maxilla which produces an increase in the distance from nasion to anterior nasal spine and causes the maxillary molars and posterior nasal spine to move away from the sella-nasion plane, (2) growth of the maxillary posterior alveolar processes causing the molar teeth to move away from the palatal plane, and (3) growth at the mandibular posterior alveolar processes causing the molar teeth to move occlusally. the vertical growth of the anterior alveolar processes does not seem to have an appreciable effect on facial height. it is merely expressed in varying degrees of overbite. the dorsal migration of the glenoid fossa is a very real factor in many cases and tends to cancel out the growth of the condyles; thus, in a sense it is arrayed on the side of vertical growth. surface additions of bone at pogonion usually have an insignificant effect, but occasionally we do see quite appreciable apposition in this area. clockwise rotation of the mandible is a result of more posterior vertical growth than condylar growth, the point of rotation being the condyles. we know that when vertical growth exceeds horizontal growth, (condylar growth) pogonion cannot keep pace with the forward growth of the upper face and the mandibular plane must become steeper (fig. 2). what effect does this type of growth have upon treatment? obviously this condition would not help reduce the anb angle, and it would not aid in correction of a class ii molar relation. however, it would tend to help correct the vertical overbite of the incisors. many such growth patterns actually do reduce the vertical overbite, perhaps the majority do not. there is ample evidence to show that dominance of vertical growth of the face facilitates the correction and retention of vertical overbite. counterclockwise rotation of the mandible is a result of more condylar growth than combined vertical growth. this type of rotation is nearly always accompanied by a forward movement of pogonion and an increase in the this type of rotation is nearly always facial angle. the point of rotation is the most distal mandibular molar in occlusal contact. this flattening of the mandibular plane tends to increase the vertical overbite and renders vertical overbite correction and retention more difficult (fig. 1).","{'answer_start': [2029], 'text': ['more condylar growth than combined vertical growth']}",,growth,"{'authors': ['F.

do tongue thrusters swallow more or less often compared to nonthrusters?,"such tongue pressures were considerably greater than lip pressures. winders concludes that the hypothesis that the force of the tongue from within the dental arch is normally compensated for by the action of the lips and cheek is not supported. by way of reservation, kydd also expresses the possibility that the lips may assert a lighter pressure for a longer duration of time than does the tongue thus equalizing lingual and labial forces. in a more recent study kydd and others showed that subjects with open bite and normal occlusion differed significantly relative to maximum pressure exerted by the tongue and upper lip during all types of swallow. tongue pressures for the open-bite sample were twice as high as the pressures exerted in the normal occlusion group. the pressure exerted by the upper lip in the open-bite sample was much less than the upper lip pressure in the normal occlusion group. comparatively then, the open-bite patients had greater tongue pressure and lesser lip pressure than were found in the normal occlusion group. significant differences in the duration of pressure were also apparent. the mean values indicated that subjects with open bite exerted both tongue and lip pressures of longer duration than were encountered in the normal group. lip pressures in the open-bite sample were of lesser magnitude but of longer duration while tongue pressures were greater and of longer duration. to consider whether or not pressures were of clinical significance, the authors projected differences in duration of pressure for the thrusters and nonthrusters over a twenty-four hour period. to do this, pressure values measured during deglutition were simply multiplied by the frequency of swallow. kydd and neff found nonthrusters to swallow at a mean rate of sixty-one times per hour while the thrusters swallowed at a rate of thirtyseven times per hour. this difference, significant at the one per cent level, revealed tongue thrusters swallowed much less often than others; however, tongue force against the teeth in the abnormal swallowers with an open bite has been found to be about twice the force generated in subjects with normal occlusion. the duration of force during swallow was also much longer in the open-bite swallowers. in summation, past studies indicate tongue thrusters swallow significantly less often than normal swallowers; however, the total effective force is about equal in normal and abnormal swallowers. the tongue-thrust swallow occurs at a significantly slower rate exerting greater lingual force over a longer duration of the swallow. the total effect of the lingual force must be evaluated in terms of the frequency of deglutition.","{'answer_start': [1946], 'text': ['tongue thrusters swallowed much less often than others']}",,pathology,"{'authors': ['J.

"regarding buccal corrdidor spaces, what is the preference of laypersons?","the mouth and teeth are considered fundamental in facial esthetics. the attractiveness of smiles has been evaluated in modern orthodontics. three aspects of smile esthetics have recently received great attention: the amount of gingival display, the presence of the smile arc, and buccal corridor spaces. a smile demonstrating minimal gingival display has been considered to be more esthetic than a smile with excessive gingival display. the smile arc is defined as the relationship of the curvature of the incisal edges of the maxillary incisors and canines to the curvature of the lower lip in the posed smile.6 the smile arc is considered ideal when the maxillary incisal edge curvature is parallel to the curvature of the lower lip. another important smile aspect is the presence or absence of buccal corridors. frush and fisher defined the buccal corridor as the spaces between the facial surfaces of the posterior teeth and the corners of the lips when the patient is smiling. they considered that the presence of the buccal corridor was important to attempt to fabricate a more natural-looking denture. they believed that a very broad denture gave the patient an unnatural denture appearance. at the present time, however, because more people are living longer and preserving their natural teeth, the perception of pleasing smile esthetics might be changing. in fact, when laypersons were shown full-face color photographs with five alterations in the buccal corridors, they preferred faces with minimal buccal corridor spaces. specifically, laypersons significantly preferred broader smiles to narrow smiles. to date, there has been no report evaluating the effects of buccal corridors on smile esthetics in the japanese population. the purpose of this study was to test the hypothesis that the amount of the buccal corridor has no influence on smile evaluations of japanese orthodontists and dental students","{'answer_start': [1476], 'text': ['they preferred faces with minimal buccal corridor spaces']}",,clinical,"{'authors': ['Hideki Ioi', 'Shunsuke Nakata', 'Amy L.

"for patients who are at risk of bacterial endocarditis, which precaution is recommended when performing orthodontic banding or debanding?","certain dental procedures that cause bleeding of the gingiva and mucosa intraorally commonly cause transient bacteremia that persists for about 15 minutes. this is rarely a concern in most patients. however, if patients have abnormal or damaged heart valves, certain bacteria may lodge in these valves and cause bacterial endocarditis. as orthodontists, we have not worried about this problem. however, the american heart association recently published their 1990 recommendations for the prevention of bacterial endocarditis. it is important that all dentists be aware of the minimum guidelines. they were published in the journal of the american medical association (264:2919-2922, 1990). antibiotic prophylaxis is recommended for all dental procedures likely to cause gingival bleeding, including professional cleaning. for the orthodontist, this would include banding and band removal. in the guidelines, the committee states that simple adjustment of orthodontic appliances does not present a significant risk of endocarditis, and therefore, antibiotic prophylaxis is not necessary. for patients who are at risk during banding and debanding, the recommended standard prophylactic regimen is amoxicillin. individuals who are allergic to penicillin should be treated with erythromycin. tetracyclines and sulfonamides are not recommended for endocarditis prophylaxis. the standard regimen for the patient at risk is 3.0 gm orally 1 hour before the procedure, and then 1.5 gm 6 hours after the initial dose. antibiotics over extensive periods of time following the procedure are not recommended since the bacteremia is not long-lasting.","{'answer_start': [690], 'text': ['antibiotic prophylaxis']}",,pathology,"{'authors': ['Vincent G.

"in orthodontics, how is patient compliance defined?","early orthodontic treatment with removable appliances is intended to prevent dentofacial unbalance in the mixed dentition and to reduce the overall need for later complex orthodontic treatment with fixed appliances. interceptive treatment is based on the principle that correction should be performed before an abnormality has fully developed. this idea was supported by king et al. when they focused on the perception of early treatment benefits. the use of a planas functional device, based on the overall rehabilitation of the stomatognathic system using neuro-occlusal rehabilitation, constitutes an effective way to correct early abnormality, including maxillary and mandibular overcrowding in the mixed dentition. the success of early orthodontic treatment with removable appliances is highly dependent on patient compliance, defined as the extent to which the patient's behavior matches the practitioner's recommendations. witt et al. described some factors that determined the patient's compliance, such as regimen, perceived comfort, patient personality, and parental attitudes, but many other influencing factors have been reported in the literature. several methods exist to assess compliance, but most are subjective and tend to overestimate wear time (wt). today, wt can be reliably measured by temperature-sensitive microsensors incorporated in the removable appliance by polymerization; the theramon sensor (theramon system; gschladt, hargelsberg, austria) is widely used for its reliability and ergonomics. the aim of the present study was to assess patient compliance in preventive expansion treatment with removable planas functional appliances. the primary objective was to estimate wt with theramon microsensors. the secondary objective was to establish how wt impacted treatment efficacy.","{'answer_start': [843], 'text': [""the extent to which the patient's behavior matches the practitioner's recommendations""]}",,clinical,"{'authors': ['Carole Charavet', 'Michel Le Gall', 'Adelin Albert', 'Annick Bruwier', 'Sophie Leroy'], 'doi': 'https://doi.org/10.2319/122917-888.1', 'meta': 'Angle Orthod (2019) 89 (1): 117–122.', 'title': 'Patient compliance and orthodontic treatment efficacy of Planas functional appliances with TheraMon microsensors'}",e007c3de-da7f-400a-bdf2-de25f871f86c
"with regards to the soft tissue profile, what is a desirable range for the nasolabial angle?","pretreatment values were compared with posttreatment values in order to evaluate the esthetic consequences of the changes produced on the descriptive statistics for the changes between posttreatment and pretreatment soft-tissue profile. this was done using scattergrams where both values are reflected for each variable and each patient, with pretreatment values on the x axis and posttreatment values on the y axis. standards of acceptable facial esthetics that, if possible, do not change with age, are necessary before conclusions can be drawn. as the e-line from ricketts shows a variable behavior with respect to the soft-tissue profile through time, and standards for the labiomental angle are not yet well established, only the following changes will be analyzed: a) the nasolabial angle b) protrusion of upper and lower lip to the sn-pg line c) depth of the sulcus superior, and d) the relationships of the soft-tissue line tot the h-line. following drobocky and smith the normal range for the nasolabial angle will between 90 to 120, with a desirable value of approximately 100 to 105. burstone established a normal protrusion of the upper lip to the sn-fg line of 3.5 +- 1.4 mm, and a normal protrusion of the lower lip to the sn-p line of 2.2 +- 1.6mm. we will therefore accept a desirable range of upper lip protrusion from +1 to +6 mm, and a desirable range of lower lip protrusion from -0.5 to +5 mm. according to holdaway, the superior sulcus depth (measured to a line perpendicular to frankfort and tangent to the upper lip) has an acceptable range of +1 to +4 mm, with +3 mm being ideal. the measurement of sulcus superior to the h-line has an acceptable range of +3 to+7 mm, with+5 mm being ideal. the distance between the lower lip and the h-line has an acceptable range between -1 and +2 mm, the ideal being between 0 and +0.5 mm. holdaway also specifies that the contour in the inferior sulcus area should fall into harmonious lines with the superior sulcus form, so we will also accept a range of +3 to +7 mm as a normal range of sulcus inferior to the h-line.","{'answer_start': [1069], 'text': ['approximately 100 to 105']}",,anatomy,"{'authors': ['Luis Alberto Bravo, MD, DDS, MS, PhD'], 'doi': 'https://doi.org/10.1043/0003-3219(1994)064<0031:STFPCA>2.0.CO;2', 'meta': 'Angle Orthod (1994) 64 (1): 31–42.', 'title': 'Soft tissue facial profile changes after orthodontic treatment with four premolars extracted'}",f701046a-caa0-4e1e-a627-a724adc4f5ba
"regarding the leeway space, what is the size differential between mandibular deciduous molars and the premolars?","in the circumpubertal growth period, spurting and differential mandibular and maxillary growth become characteristic. downs recognized this in his classical cephaloradiographic studies and it is in sicher s work that we see the explanation. he showed that, while the mandible and maxilla both grow by apposition of bone tissue, they each have, in addition, an individual bone growing method, viz., sutural growth in the maxilla and appositional cartilaginous growth in the mandible. it is the two different mechanisms of growth, sutural growth in the maxilla and appositional cartilaginous growth in the mandibular condyles, that give rise to the differential mandibular and maxillary growth so characteristic of the circumpubertal period. in normal facial growth the mandible grows at a more rapid rate than the maxilla. during the period of the deciduous dentition the mandibular teeth, carried by the body of the mandible, are progressively moving anteriorly in relation to the maxillary teeth with a reduction of horizontal and vertical overbite. for this to occur without trauma, occlusal attrition of the deciduous teeth is essential. after the permanent incisors have erupted, overjet or horizontal overbite is present in the dentition of the normal eight, nine or ten year-old child but this is very often overlooked in treatment. normally the overjet is reduced with the more rapid mandibular growth without trauma to the incisor teeth. it is because of this mandibular growth rate that the leeway space exists in the buccal segments. the maxillary deciduous molars are 1.5 mm wider than the premolars, and in the mandible the difference is 2.5 mm. this allows a latitude of mesiodistal adjustment for the erupting premolars and for the mesial inclination and drift of the permanent first molars to attain the intercuspation of satisfactory anatomical occlusion. in the natural, normal development of dental occlusion there is a high degree of correlation with the growth of the face. this is not a measurable ratio but it must exist. as growth and development are concluded, the occlusal relations of the teeth should be such that the normal function of the two temporomandibular joints is possible. with the introduction of orthodontic therapy an acceptable occlusal relation of the teeth may be achieved, but the timing with growth may be lost so that the occlusion is not coordinated with mandibular growth. at first, abnormal function may not be present as the occlusion, established orthodontically at perhaps the age of eleven years, may permit normal function. as mandibular growth continues, the disharmony develops and the same occlusal relationship of the teeth no longer permits the condyles to be in their normally balanced relations to the articular eminences when the teeth are occluded. clicking and crepitus of the temporomandibular joints is quite prevalent in our teenage retention and postretention patients. relapse or failure in treatment should encompass more than the recurrence of tooth irregularity and unsatisfactory facial contour and should include excessive functional forces on the teeth that are conducive to pathology of the vital structures, abnormal function of the temporomandibular joints, and abnormal function of the musculature.","{'answer_start': [1632], 'text': ['the difference is 2.5 mm']}",,growth,"{'authors': ['JOHN R.

"regarding mixed dentition, what is the leeway space?","leeway space is the difference in size of the mesiodistal crown widths of the primary canines and molars compared with that of their permanent successors (canine, first and second premolars; figure 1). the primary teeth typically possess a larger mesiodistal sum than the permanent teeth that replace them especially in the mandibular arch, predominantly because of the primary second molar's larger mesiodistal crown dimension compared with the second premolar. orthodontists often rely on leeway space, an anticipated gain of 1 2 mm per quadrant, in their treatment protocols to help resolve anterior crowding. it is unknown who first observed the space resulting from these crown-size differences, but nance commonly is cited as initially describing its clinical application. he coined the term leeway and labeled it a fundamental fact concerning the human dentition. nance cited descriptive tooth sizes reported as early as 1890 by g.v. black in the latter's first edition of descriptive anatomy. black's sample consisted of extracted teeth (sexes pooled) from an unreported number of cases. although the source and method of measurement is poorly defined, it is arguably the most commonly cited set of tooth dimensions, certainly so in the clinical literature. using black's figures, nance reported leeway space averages of 0.9 mm per quadrant in the maxilla and 1.7 mm per quadrant in the mandible. leeway is not a constant, but differs among people. nance described cases varying from 0.0 to 4.0 mm of mandibular leeway space. numerous authors report different averages of leeway space, apparently depending on regional or population tooth crown differences plus sampling variation. in addition, hille found that mandibular leeway space averaged 2.4 mm in girls, but was significantly smaller in boys (mean = 1.9 mm). northway et al. found that when maxillary primary first molars were lost prematurely, (1) maxillary primary second molars and permanent first molars drift mesially, (2) canines drift distally, (3) first premolars emerge more mesially, and (4) permanent maxillary canines emerge labially with risk of being blocked out. an effective solution, if treated in time, is to preserve the leeway space with, for example, a distal shoe space maintainer, lingual holding arch, or nance appliance. leeway space in the mandibular arch is often more critical; there are fewer therapeutic options in this arch because of its limited potential for expansion, unstable labialization of incisors, and difficulty of molar distalization. children in first-world countries have been experiencing secular trends over recent generations. among the best-known examples are increase in stature, reduction in age at menarche, and gain in body weight. the conventional explanations for these generational changes are centered on improved environment; diminished morbidity; and (principally) better, more dependable nutrition. positive secular trends have been described for tooth crown sizes, and larger teeth have been implicated as a contributor to dental crowding. tooth size arch length discrepancies appear to have increased. additionally, the tempo of tooth emergence has quickened. these observations suggest that environmental improvement might also affect leeway space, which is derived from differences among crown sizes.","{'answer_start': [16], 'text': ['the difference in size of the mesiodistal crown widths of the primary canines and molars compared with that of their permanent successors']}",,growth,"{'authors': ['Tyler R.

"regarding the analysis of smile esthetics, what is the buccal corridor space?","an important step in the development of an objective smile analysis involved defining smile reproducibility (figures 1a,b). a posed smile is voluntary, and it is far more reproducible than a spontaneous smile, which is elicited by emotion and is unsuitable for research purposes. when a person smiles with the lips parted, varying amounts of both upper and lower teeth are displayed. depending on the elevation of the upper lip, maxillary gingiva may also show. the level of the upper lip during smiling is referred to as the smile line. if it lies above the maxillary incisors, it is called a gingival smile line. the smile line directly affects the amount of upper incisor display and can be recorded as millimeters of gingival display or as a percentage of incisor coverage (figures 2a,b). the current literature suggests that an attractive smile shows 75% to 100% of the maxillary incisors and between 0 and 2 mm of gingiva. other authors have suggested that gingival levels above this should also be considered acceptable, since the smile line will lower as the patient ages. the interlabial gap, smile width, and smile index are interrelated esthetic measurements. the interlabial gap is the distance from the inferior border of the upper lip to the superior border of the lower lip during a posed smile (figure 3a). the smile width is the distance between the outer commissures of the lips (figure 3b). because absolute measures of interlabial gap and smile width can vary depending on patient size, they are best described in proportions. therefore, the smile index was created, which uses the interlabial gap measurement, divided by the smile width. it is generally accepted that a high smile index is more attractive. the buccal corridor space is the distance from the inner lip commissure to the most posterior visible maxillary tooth on each side (figure 4). the current esthetic description for buccal corridor space is one that is full and symmetric yet with care taken not to completely eliminate the negative space, as this creates an artificial appearance. the smile arc is the curve that passes along the incisal edges of the maxillary anterior teeth. it is generally evaluated in comparison to the curvature of the lower lip during a posed smile. a smile arc is described as consonant if it follows the curvature of the lower lip and nonconsonant if it is not parallel to the lower lip (figures 5a,b). the majority of research indicates that both orthodontists and laypeople find a consonant smile arc more attractive. a study that highlighted the need for a universal smile analysis demonstrated that an ideal posttreatment occlusion does not guarantee an attractive smile. numerous studies found no correlation between any individual component or total combined score on the american board of orthodontics' (abo) objective grading system (ogs) and whether a smile is considered attractive or unattractive by a panel of raters. the authors called for the addition of smile analysis to the ogs to more adequately describe successful treatment outcomes.","{'answer_start': [1757], 'text': ['the distance from the inner lip commissure to the most posterior visible maxillary tooth on each side']}",,clinical,"{'authors': ['Anthony L.

what are the factors that influence masticatory performance?,"our results indicate that malocclusion does result in lower masticatory performance, in agreement with several previous studies. two of these studies examined only class iii adults and our study suggests that class iii individuals have the poorest performance. shiere and manly also found the poorest performance in a small sample of class iii children, although they reported no impairment of performance in class ii and class i children. henrikson et al compared only class ii and normal occlusion girls, but found a deficiency in masticatory performance in class ii subjects similar to ours. the possible reasons why subjects with malocclusions, especially class iii malocclusions, have poorer masticatory performance are not completely understood. three factors that influence masticatory performance are: (1) the number and area of occlusal contacts, (2) occlusal forces as reflected by maximum bite force, and (3) the amount of lateral excursion during mastication. which of these factors is most important in reducing masticatory performance in subjects with malocclusion? yurkstas and manly first identified the relationship between performance and contact area. yurkstas later showed that total surface area is not a good predictor of contact area, as confirmed by julien. there have been few studies of occlusal contact areas and, therefore, it has not been established that subjects with malocclusions, especially class iii malocclusions, have fewer contacts or smaller contact area. hisano and soma showed that the adult dentition of both class ii and class iii malocclusions theoretically might be expected to apply less energy for food breakage during mastication than the class i dentition. however, their analysis did not predict lower masticatory performance in class iii malocclusions compared to class i or class ii malocclusions.","{'answer_start': [810], 'text': ['(1) the number and area of occlusal contacts, (2) occlusal forces as reflected by maximum bite force, and (3) the amount of lateral excursion during mastication']}",,clinical,"{'authors': ['Jeryl D.

"when using a base arch for intrusion retraction mehanics, which teeth are included in the anterior segment?","intrusion retraction mechanics may be initiated at this point. a three-piece base arch is fabricated as follows: a rigid anterior segment of wire (0.021"" x 0.025"" or larger stainless steel) is placed into the brackets of the four incisors and extended distally to the mesial aspect of the canines. this anterior wire is stepped up around the canines to avoid any interferences with the brackets on these teeth during intrusion and simultaneous retraction. typically, this anterior segment extends 2 or 3 mm distal to the center of resistance of the anterior segment of teeth. bilateral tipback springs fabricated with 0.017"" x 0.025"" tma are placed to deliver the intrusive force on each side. the point of force application of the intrusive force is distal to the estimated position of the center of resistance of the anterior segment of teeth (distal to the lateral incisor). thirty grams of intrusive force are applied on the right and left sides and a small distal force is added by placing an elastomeric chain extending from the molars to the anterior segment of wire on each side (figure 6). this small distal force directs the intrusive force so its line of action is lingual and parallel to the long axis of the incisors. a tipback moment is generated on the posterior segment as well as a small tip-forward moment. the anterior segment of teeth will be retracted as a result of the small tipback moment created.","{'answer_start': [221], 'text': ['the four incisors']}",,biomechanics,"{'authors': ['Bhavna Shroff, DDS, MDentSc', 'Won M.

"in growing patients affected by hemifacial microsomia, which therapy is indicated?","deficiencies in growth of 1 or both condyles of the mandible may result from multiple causes. condylar fractures at an early age may affect growth centers. congenital deformities, such as goldenhar's syndrome, nager's syndrome, craniofacial scoliosis, and pierre robin syndrome, may present mandibular hypoplasia with varying degrees of severity. hemifacial microsomia is a relatively common facial malformation, second in frequency only to clefts of the lip and palate. in this group of hypoplasias the mandibular deficiency may be associated with microtia, facial asymmetry, deviation of the chin to the affected side, and hypoplasia of the soft tissues. the unilateral deficiency in mandibular growth, including its associated soft tissues and masticatory muscles, alters symmetrical vertical growth of the maxilla and may also alter the position of the orbit. patients with branchial arch dysplasias characteristically show hypogenesis or agenesis of the condylar process and mandible. as a result, the facial deformities often become worse during growth. in growing patients, orthopedic treatment with functional appliances is often indicated. after pubertal growth, mild deformities can be corrected with orthodontic treatment, genioplasty, or unilateral mandibular augmentation, while more severe cases may require simultaneous mandibular and maxillary surgery. early surgical intervention with autogenous costochondral grafting may be indicated for patients with severe deformities. gradual traction on living tissues can create stresses that will stimulate and maintain regeneration and active growth of tissue structure. under the proper conditions, cells associated with the free surfaces of bone can differentiate into osteogenic or chondrogenic cells needed for repair or growth. the process of generating new bone by stretching was introduced by ilizarov and is called distraction osteogenesis. based on experimental and clinical studies over 35 years, he suggested that distraction osteogenesis could be used to treat 17 types of injuries or orthopedic diseases. gradual bone lengthening by distraction has been a standard procedure for treating endochondral bones of the hands and feet. synder et al described the first use of distraction osteogenesis in the canine mandible. sawaki reported distraction osteogenesis in sheep. michieli and miotti were able to lengthen the dog mandible using an intraoral distraction device attached to the mandibular dentition. other investigators have also reported successful experimental studies of mandibular lengthening by distraction osteogenesis. in 1992, mccarthy et al reported the first clinical cases of mandibular lengthening by gradual distraction. molina et al reported mandibular elongation by distraction as a farewell to major osteotomies. distraction techniques have been used in the human facial bone area for the past 10 years. the biomechanical effects of mandibular lengthening in 32 rabbits have been shown on a cellular and histological level. techniques and equipment are improving and intraoral osteogenic distraction devices have recently been developed and used.","{'answer_start': [1081], 'text': ['orthopedic treatment with functional appliances']}",,pathology,"{'authors': ['Azita Tehranchi, DMD', 'Hossein Behnia, DMD'], 'doi': 'https://doi.org/10.1043/0003-3219(2000)070<0165:TOMABD>2.0.CO;2', 'meta': 'Angle Orthod (2000) 70 (2): 165–174.', 'title': 'Treatment of Mandibular Asymmetry by Distraction Osteogenesis and Orthodontics: A Report of Four Cases'}",3e15df1e-4e9c-4fd8-9004-e2758dddef1c
"with respect to impacted or erupting third molars, are third molars a cause mandibular incisor crowding?","on the other hand, a study by ades4 reported no differences in dental arch length and crowding in the presence or absence of third molars in orthodontic patients 10 years post retention. therefore, it was concluded that removal of third molars to alleviate anterior crowding may not be justified. in another study, harradine et al randomized 44 of 77 patients to have their third molars removed after completion of retention after orthodontic treatment. sixty-six months later, their start and finish study casts were digitized on a reflex microscope to determine little's index of irregularity, intercanine width, and arch length. when third molars were extracted, the mean increase in lower labial segment irregularity was reduced by 1.1 mm from a mean of 2.1 mm for the group in which third molars were retained. this difference was not considered clinically significant. moreover, based on an extensive literature review, bishara in 1999 also concluded that, according to the available data, third molars do not play a significant role in mandibular anterior crowding. in 1971, laskin surveyed american orthodontists and oral and maxillofacial surgeons on their opinions about the role of erupting third molars in causing anterior tooth crowding. this study showed that about 65% of orthodontists and oral and maxillofacial surgeons recommended removal of third molars to prevent crowding because they believed that erupting third molars generate an anterior force. because of considerable variation in the management of asymptomatic third molars and ongoing controversy, mettes et al in 2005 conducted an extensive review to evaluate the effects of prophylactic removal of asymptomatic impacted wisdom teeth in adolescents and adults compared with retention of these wisdom teeth. they concluded that no evidence supported or rejected prophylactic removal of asymptomatic impacted wisdom teeth in adults. however, some evidence suggested that removal of these teeth in adolescents did not have an effect in terms of reducing or preventing late incisor crowding. furthermore, mettes et al recommended that clinicians should inform patients of the lack of evidence on this controversial issue.","{'answer_start': [996], 'text': ['third molars do not play a significant role in mandibular anterior crowding']}",,clinical,"{'authors': ['E.

"in subjects with mesial step terminal plane in primary dentition, what is the relationship between the degree of the mesial step and the permanent molar relationship?","individuals with a flush terminal plane relationship present a more challenging diagnostic question. of these cases, 56% became class i and 44% became class ii in the permanent dentition. in other words, slightly less than half of these cases will progress to a class ii or end-to-end occlusion. these findings imply that what was previously considered as normal occlusion in the primary or mixed dentitions, in reality, does not often result in a normal occlusion in the permanent dentition. therefore, it is important for the clinician to closely observe these cases and to initiate treatment when needed at the appropriate time. in the 56.4% of individuals with a flush terminal plane, placing a lower lingual holding arch to maintain space may have an adverse effect on the developing dentition (ie, it may prevent more cases with a flush terminal plane from becoming class i). this is important to remember because orthodontists, pediatric dentists, and general dentists often consider placing a lower lingual arch as a preventive or interceptive but noninvasive procedure. one can readily imagine how maintaining arch length and preventing the mesial drift of the mandibular permanent molars, can adversely affect the changes in the molar relationship from the mixed to the permanent dentitions. as a result, in cases with an end to end molar relationship in which a lingual arch is placed, the clinician should consider using headgear or other appliances to obtain a class i occlusion. the parents should be made aware of such a possibility beforehand. of the cases with a 1 mm mesial step, 76% became class i, 23% became class ii, and 1% became class iii. in cases with a mesial step of 2 mm or more in the primary dentition, 68% became class i, 13% became class ii, and 19% became class iii. these findings indicated that the greater the mesial step, the greater the probability for the molar relationship to develop into a class i occlusion. the findings also indicated that a more favorable molar relationship in the primary dentition would lessen the chance for a class ii occlusion developing in the permanent dentition. however, it will not prevent it! in other words, some cases with a mesial step may still develop into class ii molars in the permanent dentition. such changes will occur in a smaller percentage of cases. finally, the incidence of a class iii molar relationship in the permanent dentition increased as the magnitude of the mesial step increased in the primary dentition. the incidence was 1% with a 1 mm mesial step, and increased to 19% with a mesial step of 2 mm or more. therefore, as clinicians we need to periodically evaluate the changes in the occlusal relationship in our young patients in order to inform the parents of any developing adverse relationships that might require future treatment.","{'answer_start': [1831], 'text': ['the greater the mesial step, the greater the probability for the molar relationship to develop into a class i occlusion']}",,growth,"{'authors': ['Samir E.

"regarding the properties of alloys used in orthodontic wires, what is the difference in the modulus of elasticity between nickel-titanium (niti) and stainless steel?","wire type and size table 4 reveals four stiffness values at 2 mm deflection that are negative (n 021x025, n 021x025 9s, n 018, n 016). on the contrary, no negative values are seen in table 3. the values in table 3 reflect the stiffness properties of the wires, and one would not expect to measure negative values. however, in the three-bracket system, the stiffness parameter measured reflects the combined effects of friction, binding, deflection, constraint of the longitudinal shape of the wire especially from a facial perspective, and wire stiffness. increasing force with decreasing deflection was observed, yielding a negative value for the slope. in general, the lowest stiffnesses were delivered by the n 017x025 9s wire sample and the highest by the 021x025 sample. the lowest stiffnesses were generally delivered by the multistrand nickel-titanium wires regardless of the bending mode employed. this was not surprising, considering that the modulus of elasticity for nickel-titanium is roughly one-fourth that of stainless steel and that the introduction of multiple strands into nickel-titanium wire configuration further lowered stiffness. the three and sixstrand round stainless steel wires, as well as the 016x016 eight-strand stainless steel wire and the 016 and 018 nickel-titanium wires, were also very low in stiffness, regardless of the mode of bending employed. due to the greater variability of stiffness values obtained in the three-bracket mode, there were fewer significant differences among the wire samples. for single-strand wires of both alloys, stiffness increased with an increase in wire size. the exception was for the nickel-titanium wires at 2 mm of deflection in the three-bracket bending test in which stiffness did not change. for multistrand wires, there was a trend for higher stiffness values with increase in wire size, but it was not consistent.","{'answer_start': [948], 'text': ['the modulus of elasticity for nickel-titanium is roughly one-fourth that of stainless steel']}",,materials,"{'authors': ['Jay M.

"according to fisk, what are the morphological variations of class ii divsion 1 malocclusions?","a study of patterns of individuals carried out by him shows the same basic conformation, although various types could be differentiated. these parts may be normal in size and form individually, but an unfortunate combination can result in malocclusion and facial imbalance. fisk, et al listed the following morphological variations in class ii, division 1 malocclusion: (1) the maxillary bones and teeth are anteriorly situated with relation to the cranium; (2) the maxillary teeth are anteriorly placed in the maxillary bones; (3) the mandible is underdeveloped; (4) the mandible is of normal size but posteriorly placed; (5) the mandibular teeth are posteriorly placed on an adequate base; (6) any combination of the above. altemus, as one of his conclusions stated: this problem [of class ii, division 1] has raised broad questions as to the validity of angles system of occlusal classification in cephalofacial analysis. no clear-cut dimensional or angular differences were found between the two groups, one with normal occlusion, and the other with class ii, division 1 malocclusion. the angle classification is dental; with but few exceptions these measurements funder his study] were on associated skeletal framework. it is entirely possible that a purely dental malocclusion may not be reflected to the point of significance, in the facial skeletal complex. bjork has shown that the cranial base or saddle angle provides a measure of the shape or deflection of the cranial base. increased maxillary prognathism is partly due to increased length of upper jaw and partly due to forward displacement of upper facial structures as indicated by position of the pterygomaxillary fissure. the prognathism of the maxilla and the mandible may increase, remain unchanged, or diminish independently of each other. reduced mandibular prognathism depends upon the change in shape of the cranial base which becomes longer and flatter. the effect is increased overjet.","{'answer_start': [370], 'text': ['(1) the maxillary bones and teeth are anteriorly situated with relation to the cranium; (2) the maxillary teeth are anteriorly placed in the maxillary bones; (3) the mandible is underdeveloped; (4) the mandible is of normal size but posteriorly placed; (5) the mandibular teeth are posteriorly placed on an adequate base; (6) any combination of the above']}",,anatomy,"{'authors': ['Soona B.

"in females from 13 to 20 years old, how does incisor irregularity change with age?","to help separate the effects of growth from those of treatment changes in stability studies, several authors have studied arch dimension changes in untreated samples. moorees, in an untreated sample, found that the mandibular intermolar distance increased between the ages of 9 and 14, but thereafter remained constant. arch length decreased between the ages of 9 and 14, corresponding to the replacement of the deciduous by the teeth, and remained constant after 14 years of age. intercanine width changes in untreated samples have been studied by barrow and white, moorrees, and sillman. they all observed that there is a rapid increase in intercanine width from 6 to 9 years of age, due to permanent incisor and canine eruption. from 10 to 12 years of age intercanine width decreases, and the decrease remains stable according to moorrees and sillman but continues to decrease according to other authors. moorrees suggested that the decreasing incisor-canine circumference noted from 12 to 18 years is associated with a decrease in arch length rather than a narrowing of arch width. sinclair and little examined 65 untreated normal and revealed a consistent trend toward a decrease in arch length in the mixed dentition to early adulthood. there was a slight decrease in intercanine width, especially in females from 13 to 20 years old. molar width generally remained the same. incisor irregularity increased in the 13 to 20-year-old females, with females exhibiting more incisor irregularity than males in all stages. no association or predictors of clinical value were found.","{'answer_start': [1381], 'text': ['incisor irregularity increased']}",,clinical,"{'authors': ['Steven A.

"regarding craniofacial growth, how does the chin move as a result of vertical growth in the molar area?","when pogonion and nasion grow forward at an equal rate, increment a will equal the sum of increments i, ii, iii and iv. in other words, growth at the condyles must equal the anteroposterior growth at nasion, plus the vertical growth of the corpus of the maxilla, plus the vertical growth of the maxillary alveolar process, plus the vertical growth of the mandibular alveolar process. then it may be said that the horizontal growth at the condyles is pitted against combined vertical growth. growth at the condyles is trying to carry the chin forward and combined vertical growth in the molar area is trying to carry the chin downward. the result is usually downward and forward; however, it may be downward and backward as we shall see. when growth at a exceeds i, ii, iii, and iv, the mandibular plane becomes flatter and pogonion moves forward more than nasion. when the sum of i, ii, and iv appreciably exceeds a, pogonion will usually move backward with relation to nasion and the mandibular plane will become steeper. when growth at a equals the sum of iii, and iv the mandibular plane moves down in a parallel manner. however, excessive mesial movement of the molar teeth causes difficulty in measuring vertical increments. the ratio between horizontal and vertical growth increments is called the posterior growth analysis. it is an aid in explaining the postural behavior of the mandible (fig. 2). please bear in mind that it is the relationship of these increments one to another which controls the forward growth and the rotation of the mandible.","{'answer_start': [572], 'text': ['growth in the molar area is trying to carry the chin downward']}",,growth,"{'authors': ['F.

"in children, what event coincides with increases in arch width?","korkhaus and neumann (31) showed that the absence of physiological spacing in the primary dentition did not predispose to irregular tooth arrangement. greve (33) did not believe ponts index to be reliable because an index could not be expected to fit precisely in each individual case. this statement was made after testing ponts index by obtaining comparative averages from new serial observations. ritters research (33) on the relationship of the mesio-distal diameters of the teeth of the maxilla to those of the mandible, showed that the coefficient of correlation varied directly as the diameters of the teeth in the two jaws. goldstein and stanton (35) made a study of growth and development of maxillary and mandibular arches and showed a spurt of growth in total arch length, for both males and females at 9 years of age. lewis found that primary arches became wider between the ages of 6-8 years to compensate for increased size of the permanent incisors. lewis and lehman (39) showed that increased width is coincident with eruption of the permanent incisors and cuspids. the permanent incisors and cuspids. cohen (40) verified the findings of lewis (36) and lewis and lehman (39) and observed further that some increase in lateral width occurred in the first primary molar region of the mandible between the ages of 6-10 years. the distance between the mesial side of the cuspid and the distal side of the primary second molar in the mandible, also was observed to become consistently smaller as the primary teeth were lost being approximately 2 mm. narrower at 13 1/2 years than at 8 1/2 years of age. nance (47) concluded that the measurements from the first permanent molar around to the mesio-buccal of the first molar of the opposite side, as well as that from the mesio-lingual of the mandibular first permanent molar of one side at the point where the lingual tissues touch the crown of the tooth, to the gingival tissues between the mandibular central incisors at their lateral aspect, were always shortened in the transition from mixed to permanent dentition. this conclusion is practically the same as that of cohen nance suggested methods that might be used to align teeth in non-rotated positions. he implied that stability of result following orthodontic movement of teeth was limited to a marked degree. for instance, he observed that expansion as a satisfactory solution to the problem of arch length, failed in the majority of cases because the greatest permanent increase in arch length was 2.6 mm. increase arch length was 2.6 mm.","{'answer_start': [999], 'text': ['increased width is coincident with eruption of the permanent incisors and cuspids']}",,growth,"{'authors': ['Douglas C.

"regarding the biology of tooth movement, what causes hyalinization?","assuming that a pressure of about 20 kpa would result in optimal tooth movement, pilon et al performed a series of standardized experiments in dogs in which they used forces of 50, 100, or 200 cn to move mandibular second premolars in beagle dogs. these forces were supposed to result in local pressures of 10, 20, or 40 kpa. these conditions were supposed to represent low, moderate, or high pressures, respectively. their results indicated that all these pressures evoke a similar tissue response. large individual differences, however, were found in the rate of tooth movement irrespective of the applied force. the development of hyalinized areas could play an important role in this interindividual variation. tissue necrosis (hyalinization) is caused by excessive compression of the pdl as a result of too much pressure. after the removal of the hyalinized tissue by neutrophil granulocytes and macrophages, and after undermining resorption by osteoclasts, the phase of acceleration begins and orthodontic tooth displacement proper starts. quinn and yoshikawa suggested four different models for the relation between force magnitude and subsequent orthodontic tooth movement. they suggested in model 3 that at low force levels a dose-response relation might exist between the force magnitude and rate of tooth movement. in that range, hyalinization would play only a minor role or even no role at all. increases in pressure levels would lead to an optimal tissue response persisting over a wide range of pressures. the role of hyalinization on the individual level would increase with higher pressures. forces resulting in pressures beyond the advocated levels would result in slower tooth movement because of extensive hyalinization of the pdl. if this reasoning is correct, one has to assume that at forces below about 40 cn, no hyalinization will be found, whereas pressures beyond 275 cn would result in extensive hyalinization. the published literature is not conclusive on this subject because different types of orthodontic appliances were used, and the direction, duration, and type of tooth movement showed a huge variation, and, therefore, the comparison of the effects of different force levels on tooth movement is difficult.9 therefore, the aim of the present study was to evaluate rate of tooth movement and tissue reactions after standardized application of low (25 cn) and high (300 cn) orthodontic forces that lead to low and high pressures in the pdl of different teeth within one experimental animal.","{'answer_start': [760], 'text': ['excessive compression of the pdl as a result of too much pressure']}",,biology,"{'authors': ['Martina Von Böhl, DDS', 'Jaap Maltha, PhD', 'Hans Von den Hoff, PhD', 'Anne Marie Kuijpers-Jagtman, DDS, PhD, FDSRCSEng'], 'doi': 'https://doi.org/10.1043/0003-3219(2004)074<0016:CITPLA>2.0.CO;2', 'meta': 'Angle Orthod (2004) 74 (1): 16–25.', 'title': 'Changes in the Periodontal Ligament After Experimental Tooth Movement Using High and Low Continuous Forces in Beagle Dogs'}",d48409d0-1fc9-43f1-aea1-41395423a684
"regarding the growth of the craniofacial complex, what are the two mechanisms of growth in the maxilla?","the primary growth cartilages, the first skeletal components to appear in early embryonic life, control growth in the cranial base and the limbs. the mechanism of growth in the synchondroses of the cranial base and the epiphyseal plates of the limbs is the same, ie, growth of the cartilage followed by its transformation into bone as maturing cartilage is replaced with bone. the timing is quite different in the craniofacial and limb areas, however. growth of the cranial base parallels growth of the brain and is largely complete by age 6, while growth in the limbs proceeds much more slowly and peaks at adolescence. the early cessation of growth in the synchondroses of the cranial base means that, by the time treatment of short stature in ts patients typically begins, there is no longer the possibility of a significant response in that area. forward growth of the maxilla occurs by 2 mechanisms. first, the nasomaxillary complex is pushed forward by growth at the sphenoethmoidal (s-e) and (less importantly) interethmoidal (i-s) synchondroses. this lengthens the anterior cranial base and moves the entire midface more anteriorly. second, the maxilla and associated structures are pulled forward by further development of the soft tissue complex in which they are embedded, and growth at the posterior and superior sutures moves the nasomaxillary complex away from the cranial base. the first mechanism is quite important up to age 6, when growth at the s-e and i-s synchondroses is completed; the second mechanism accounts for almost all maxillary growth thereafter. a characteristic midface deficiency is observed in achondroplasia, the autosomal dominant genetic syndrome that produces dwarfs with a reasonably normal trunk length but very short arms and legs. in these children, the midface deficiency is due not to a small maxilla but to the failure of a reasonably normal maxilla to be translated anteriorly into a normal position because the cranial base does not lengthen as it should. the midface deficiency in turner syndrome arises from the same cause. the dimensions of the maxilla are reasonably normal, but its position is not. as laine et al have noted,19 palate length as measured on dental casts is normal in turner syndrome, and table 1 demonstrates that the cephalometric measurement of maxillary length (pns-ans) also was close to the controls. since the cartilage of the cranial base grows only up to about age 6, one would expect little effect on the position of the maxilla from gh administration in older children. our sample of children who received early administration of gh was simply too small to confirm the forward movement of the maxilla that probably would occur if gh could be given early enough.","{'answer_start': [905], 'text': ['first, the nasomaxillary complex is pushed forward by growth at the sphenoethmoidal (s-e) and (less importantly) interethmoidal (i-s) synchondroses. this lengthens the anterior cranial base and moves the entire midface more anteriorly. second, the maxilla and associated structures are pulled forward by further development of the soft tissue complex in which they are embedded, and growth at the posterior and superior sutures moves the nasomaxillary complex away from the cranial base']}",,growth,"{'authors': ['Andrew D.

"in orthodontic, how does the average treatment time for a class ii malocclusion compares to a class i malocclusion?","finally, to achieve an ideal class i molar relationship for the patient presenting with a class ii malocclusion, class ii elastics or an alternative noncompliant device with fixed appliances or clear aligners would typically be utilized. according to djeu et al. in 2005, invisalign received poorer scores using the america board of orthodontics objective grading system for large anteroposterior corrections compared with conventional braces. however, since the results of that study were published, align technology introduced invisalign g3 with precision cuts to accommodate the use of elastics for anteroposterior correction. similar to the patient with severe crowding, general dentists were significantly more willing to treat a class ii malocclusion compared with orthodontists, although they were significantly less likely to use class ii elastics (37% vs 92%). alternatively, several orthodontists noted in a free-form comment that they were confident treating the patient, but they would not correct the class ii relationship. others mentioned that they would use a fixed appliance, such as a molar distalizer, before beginning treatment to achieve a class i relationship first. this hesitation to treat a class ii malocclusion with invisalign may have been due to orthodontists' experience with conventional braces. research has shown that treating a patient with class ii division 1 malocclusion can take an average of 5 months longer than treating a class i malocclusion, and that treatment time may be influenced by a variety of factors, including the type of class ii corrector used, number of months of elastic wear, compliance, and average time between appointments. since general dentists were more confident treating class ii malocclusions than orthodontists, but less likely to use elastics, it seems that most were not aiming to alter the molar and canine classification. vic ns and russo, who also found that general dentists were more likely to treat a class ii discrepancy in their study, hypothesized that they may have had different treatment objectives as a result of their varied educational background. in other words, general dentists who treat class ii malocclusions with aligners but without the auxiliaries necessary for classification correction may be aiming primarily for esthetic alignment. orthodontists, on the other hand, may be more focused on occlusion in addition to alignment, and so their treatment objectives may have resulted in the decreased confidence demonstrated for treating a class ii malocclusion.","{'answer_start': [1351], 'text': ['treating a patient with class ii division 1 malocclusion can take an average of 5 months longer than treating a class i malocclusion']}",,clinical,"{'authors': ['Alexandra D.

"regarding the segmented arch technique for space closure, what is the require moment to force ratio (m/f) to achieve translation movements?","orthodontists accomplish space closure in different ways, depending on the diagnosis and treatment plan. frictionless systems of space closure are superior to systems which introduce friction as a means of space closure. an appliance system without friction allows greater control of tooth movement during space closure. specialized precalibrated springs for space closure are an integral part of the segmented arch technique. precalibrated attraction springs have three characteristics of interest: 1) the alpha (anterior) moment produced by the spring; 2) the beta (posterior) moment produced by the spring; and 3) the horizontal force generated. the type of movement is dictated by the moment to force ratio (m/f) generated by the appliance at the attachments. typically, m/f ratios of approximately 7:1 millimeters result in controlled tipping, 10:1 millimeters result in translational movements, and values of 12:1 millimeters or greater accomplish root movement. these ratios are based on the assumptions that the root lengths are 12 millimeters, the distance from the bracket slot to the alveolar crest is five millimeters, the alveolar bone condition is normal, the axial inclination of the teeth is normal, and the center of resistance is located apically a distance .40 times the root length when measured from the alveolar crest to the apex. the variation of the center of resistance with differing levels of bony support is shown in figure 1. with a change in the center of resistance the m/f ratio must be modified (figure 2); thus, in adult patients with periodontal loss, higher m/f values must be attained.","{'answer_start': [849], 'text': ['10:1 millimeters']}",,biomechanics,"{'authors': ['Clemens Manhartsberger, DDS, MD', 'John Y.

"in cleft lip and palate patients, what is the rate of relapse after lefort i advancement surgery?","as for the vertical dimension, the movement was less than 3 mm in four studies and between 3 and 7 mm in three studies. however, the vertical relapse in a-point was variable between the studies. two particular articles that were judged as high-quality articles reported more than 50% of vertical relapse in a-point. in the randomized controlled trial published by chua et al., the authors reported conventional le fort i advancement of cleft lip and palate (clp) patients was 6.8 mm and a relapse rate was 37% (2.5 mm) after 5 years of follow-up. the findings of this systematic review suggest that do can be expected to relapse about 15% (1.5 mm) after 10 mm of do advancement in clp patients. the lower relapse rate in the do technique compared with le fort conventional osteotomy may be explained by the gradual movement of the maxilla as well as the resistance of the external or internal distracter. these two factors reduce the unwanted backward and upward pull caused by the scarred tissues and muscles. the literature identified by the current systematic review suggested that the method of distraction was an important predictor of long-term stability. the long-term skeletal stability after do was higher in the studies that used internal distracters than the studies that used external distracters. the rate of relapse was less than 10% in the three studies that used internal distracters, which may be related to the differences in the method of delivering forces from the distracter. in addition to the disharmony of occlusion, the presence of scarred palatal and lip tissues as well as posterior pharyngeal flaps from a prior surgery are expected to be the main reasons for relapse in clp patients. soft tissue scaring is known to be one of the greatest challenges facing surgical management of clp patients, and has been suggested as an etiologic cause for the higher incidence of mid-face deficiency in clp populations. fibrotic scar tissue may restrict the movement of the maxilla and is thought to be significant for relapse to the preadvanced position. finally, a well-conducted and clearly reported randomized controlled clinical trial comparing the results of conventional orthognathic surgery and do in patients with clp would be very useful in assessing the differences in the skeletal and dental stability between the two techniques in short-term and long-term follow-up.","{'answer_start': [506], 'text': ['37% (2.5 mm) after 5 years of follow-up']}",,clinical,"{'authors': ['Humam Saltaji', 'Michael P.

"regarding the biology of tooth movement, what is the effect of hyalinization caused by excessive forces on the bone resorption?","light continuous force results in a relatively smooth progression of tooth movement by frontal resorption.1 however, traditional orthodontic appliances are not suitable for generating light force because of their material properties, and the force decreases as the tooth moves. we have reported the effect of initially light and gradually increasing force generated by magnets on tooth movement in a previous study. magnets generate initially light force that depends on the distance between magnets, and the force gradually increases as the magnets move closer to each other. although application of initially heavy force followed by gradual increasing force (previous study experimental group 1) showed a lag phase in the initial stage, application of an initially light force followed by a gradually increasing force (previous study experimental group 2) induced tooth movement without a lag phase (figure 1). orthodontic tooth movement is dependent on the ability of periodontal cells to react to the mechanical stimuli. for tooth movement, osteoclast recruitment and activation must be induced to remove bone from the area adjacent to the pressure side of the periodontal tissue. a correlation has been reported in young rats between the number of osteoclasts and the rate of tooth movement. on the other hand, hyalinization in periodontal tissue will limit tooth movement. hyalinization not only inhibits the osteoclastic recruitment in the compressed area for frontal resorption, but also strongly induces the undermining resorption. this degenerative change is caused by excessive force for the periodontal tissue. von b hl et al showed that areas of hyalinization are associated with all applied force levels and also suggested that the development and removal of necrotic tissue is a continuous process during tooth displacement. delay of the alveolar bone resorption was induced by the removal of hyalinized tissue and, moreover, is suggested to have a correlation with root resorption. although the histology and biomechanics of many kinds of orthodontic forces have been described, the histological response to initially light and gradually increasing forces is not fully clarified. in a clinical investigation, iwasaki et al concluded that effective tooth movement can be produced with lower forces. it was then hypothesized that smooth tooth movement by initially light and gradually increasing forces could be a result of less hyalinization and increased recruitment of osteoclasts in the compressed area without undermining resorption. the current study histologically evaluated effects of the initially light and gradually increasing force on orthodontic tooth movement in rats.","{'answer_start': [1379], 'text': ['hyalinization not only inhibits the osteoclastic recruitment in the compressed area for frontal resorption, but also strongly induces the undermining resorption']}",,biology,"{'authors': ['Ryo Tomizuka', 'Yoshinaka Shimizu', 'Hiroyasu Kanetaka', 'Akihiro Suzuki', 'Sachiko Urayama', 'Masayoshi Kikuchi', 'Hideo Mitani', 'Kaoru Igarashi'], 'doi': 'https://doi.org/10.2319/0003-3219(2007)077[0410:HEOTEO]2.0.CO;2', 'meta': 'Angle Orthod (2007) 77 (3): 410–416.', 'title': 'Histological Evaluation of the Effects of Initially Light and Gradually Increasing Force on Orthodontic Tooth Movement'}",a429b651-83e0-4d5e-8d52-378233442a6e
"in patients with cleft, what was confirmed from the comparison of patients operated in childhood and unoperated adult patients?","the aims of the interdisciplinary treatment for cleft patients consist of (1) repairing the morphological alteration, (2) allowing for normal speech without loss of hearing capacity, and (3) avoiding impairment of the facial and upper dental arch growth. these requirements should be achieved without overburdening patients' families with excessive therapies that do not bring compensatory results. intercenter studies have shown that early therapeutic procedures that are added to the basic protocol of treatment do not necessarily bring advantages to the final results. sagittal deficiency of the midface, leading to a concave facial profile, is the most striking feature in adult complete unilateral cleft lip and palate patients. such a deficiency, as shown in figure 1, cannot be attributed to the cleft itself. previous reports have shown that there is some maxillary prognathism associated with upper dental protrusion in adult unoperated cleft patients. on the other hand, some studies show a deficiency of maxillary growth when comparing adult cleft patients who have been operated on at conventional times, ie, during childhood, to unoperated adult cleft patients, thus confirming the restraining effect of the repairing surgeries (figure 2). this midface deficiency, reported in many articles, is progressive and can be observed in early ages. different from the maxilla, however, growth direction and morphology of the mandible are inherent to the cleft and are not vulnerable to surgical procedures. mandibles of cleft lip and palate patients have shorter bodies and rami and more obtuse gonial angles. palate repair has been considered to be very harmful to maxillary growth. such an idea has led to protocols of treatment that include either the delay of palate repair or its performance at 2 surgical times, thus postponing the closure of the hard palate. for instance, marburg's protocol in germany advocates closure of the soft palate at 6 months of age in order to guarantee better speech and closure of the hard palate not earlier than 13 years of age on average. nevertheless, our experience at the hospital for rehabilitation of craniofacial anomalies (hrca), from the university of s o paulo in bauru, brazil, with adult complete unilateral cleft lip and palate patients submitted only to lip repair during childhood confirms the greater aggressiveness of the primary lip repair upon the midface growth, as illustrated by the superimposition shown in figure 3. this may be explained by the strong restraining force that the repaired lip exerts on the segmented maxilla.","{'answer_start': [1191], 'text': ['the restraining effect of the repairing surgeries']}",,pathology,"{'authors': ['Omar Gabriel da Silva Filho', 'Fabrizio Calvano', 'Antônio Guedes Alcoforado Assunção', 'Arlete de Oliveira Cavassan'], 'doi': 'https://doi.org/10.1043/0003-3219(2001)071<0274:CMICWC>2.0.CO;2', 'meta': 'Angle Orthod (2001) 71 (4): 274–284.', 'title': 'Craniofacial Morphology in Children with Complete Unilateral Cleft Lip and Palate: A Comparison of Two Surgical Protocols'}",e404eac0-e7c8-4fb7-830c-d478591f10aa
"in growing patients, how does age affect the success of functional appliances?","selecting cases that will ensure a successful response to functional appliance therapy remains a problem because the treatment results are often variable and unpredictable. a wide individual variation in the response to treatment is evident even if broadly similar malocclusions are treated. differing responses to treatment may be due to the design of the appliances. the possibility exists that different functional appliance designs act in dissimilar ways and are not directly comparable. variations in appliance action such as the amount of mandibular advancement, types of construction bite, and prescribed time of wear are so marked that practically no two investigators use similar appliance design and construction bite. the use of functional appliances to coincide with the pubertal growth spurt has been emphasized. bj rk found that the effectiveness of functional appliances is reduced as patients get older. cohen suggested that treatment should start before the patient achieves peak growth rate in order to take advantage of periods of fast growth, which both precede and follow the peak growth rate itself. at present, it is difficult to predict the precise timing of the peak rate of facial growth before it takes place, but studies have shown a strong correlation between the peak of facial growth and peak height velocity. tanner et al found that the peak height velocity occurred, on average, at 12 years in girls and at 14 years in boys. it has been suggested that the success of a functional appliance is totally dependent on cooperation. the minimum amount of wear that results in successful treatment is not known. in view of this, instructing patients to wear an appliance full time would maximize the opportunity for success, especially if one can only expect the patient to wear the appliance for 50% of the instructed time. individual differences in sensory and neuromuscular response to functional appliance therapy could also be responsible for variations in treatment outcome. it has been shown that successful functional therapy is accompanied by specific transient changes in the reflex activity of the masseter. assuming that a patient is compliant and is wearing the appliance as instructed, it may be that pretreatment skeletal morphologic factors are responsible for a poor treatment outcome. parkhouse demonstrated that those patients who responded successfully to therapy had a larger pretreatment anb angle. ahlgren and laurin concluded that the pretreatment anb value was the only morphologic difference between successfully and unsuccessfully treated cases. a more recent study found that, the smaller the snb angle prior to treatment, the more successful was the reduction in overjet. the authors suggested that individuals with a small snb angle would posture the mandible further forward, resulting in an increased muscle stretch, which may enhance the effectiveness of the appliance.","{'answer_start': [843], 'text': ['the effectiveness of functional appliances is reduced as patients get older']}",,clinical,"{'authors': ['H.

what is interproximal enamel reduction (ipr)?,"the grinding of interproximal tooth surfaces was first described by ballard in 1944 as a method to correct a lack of harmony in tooth size. interdental stripping, also known as interproximal enamel reduction (ipr), is a common clinical procedure in orthodontics used to gain space, correct bolton tooth-size discrepancies, rectify morphologic anomalies, and reduce interdental gingival papillary retraction. currently, ipr is performed by using handheld or motor-driven abrasive strips, handpiece-mounted, diamond-coated disks, and tungsten-carbide or diamond burs. many studies have investigated the effects of various interdental stripping methods on the enamel surface. it has been reported that ipr creates enamel furrows and scratches that might promote greater plaque retention and increase risk of caries. for this reason, several treatment protocols have been proposed to achieve a smooth surface. nowadays, various mechanical or automatic rotating devices can produce enamel surfaces that are even smoother than natural enamel in a reasonable time and with a good acceptance by the patient. danesh et al. reported that after polishing, surfaces that had been treated with an automatic oscillating system presented with better results in terms of smoothness. recently, various methods have been gradually improved with the primary goal of obtaining precise ipr in terms of optimal amount of enamel grinding. many authors recommend a reduction of no more than half the enamel coating's original thickness to avoid immoderate degradation. it has been claimed that 0.3 0.4 mm of enamel can be safely removed, making ipr a minimally invasive procedure. several investigators have reported that mechanical stripping can reduce chairside time, achieving more and better interproximal reduction than manual techniques. johner et al. demonstrated that, when testing three different mechanical stripping methods, the average amount of stripping was generally smaller than the intended amount of enamel reduction. although many studies have analyzed enamel surfaces after stripping, no data exist on the quantitative and qualitative evaluation of abrasive strips before and after use. in fact, the amount of enamel reduction depends on several factors, such as exerted pressure and enamel hardness, but mostly on particle size of the abrasive and the time used to apply it. therefore, the aim of the present study was to test in vitro and in vivo the wear performance of flexible, oscillating diamond-coated strips compared with unused strips by means of the tribological test and scanning electronic microscope (sem).","{'answer_start': [218], 'text': ['a common clinical procedure in orthodontics used to gain space, correct bolton tooth-size discrepancies, rectify morphologic anomalies, and reduce interdental gingival papillary retraction']}",,clinical,"{'authors': ['Roberta Lione', 'Francesca Gazzani', 'Chiara Pavoni', 'Stefano Guarino', 'Vincenzo Tagliaferri', 'Paola Cozza'], 'doi': 'https://doi.org/10.2319/071516-552.1', 'meta': 'Angle Orthod (2017) 87 (3): 455–459.', 'title': 'In vitro and in vivo evaluation of diamond-coated strips'}",d6928883-a8ee-4a2d-878f-99ad089bc838

"regarding mandibular growth, what effect does mandibular rotation have lower incisors?","consideration should also be given to the rotation of the jaws, as it can also influence the paths of eruption of the teeth in the course of occlusal development. bjork (1969) and bjork and skieller (1972) suggested that compensatory changes occur in the inclination of the lower incisors, according to the direction of growth rotation of the jaws as their functional positions are maintained. the labial segment would be expected to tip forward on the mandibular base in a forward rotator, while it would become retroclined in a backward rotator. however, bjork and skieller (1972) also noted that the inclination of the anterior teeth is affected to a greater extent by functional factors, so that incisor position in the face and in relation to opposing teeth tends to be stable, regardless of the direction of any rotation. by superimposing the tracings on bjorks mandibular structures (bjork 1955, 1969), no indication of extreme rotation was found in the sample examined in the present study. most were mild forward rotators, and the eight backward rotators did not exhibit any different type of adaptive behavior in the lower incisor segment.","{'answer_start': [221], 'text': ['compensatory changes occur in the inclination of the lower incisors']}",,growth,"{'authors': ['Francesca Miotti'], 'doi': 'https://doi.org/10.1043/0003-3219(1984)054<0163:TPLAIF>2.0.CO;2', 'meta': 'Angle Orthod (1984) 54 (2): 163–175.', 'title': 'The Passive Lingual Arch in First Bicuspid Extraction'}",53877626-8c66-4ebe-88fe-408c2828548f
"regarding the clinical presentation of congenital disorders, what characteristics and manifestations of associated with cleidocranial dysostosis (ccd)?","cleidocranial dysostosis (ccd) is a rare congenital disorder of bone with an autosomal dominant hereditary mode of inheritance. this condition is characterized by clavicular aplasia or deficient formation of the clavicles, delayed and imperfect ossification of the cranium, moderately short stature, and a variety of other skeletal abnormalities. the oral manifestations are a delayed exfoliation of primary teeth, delayed or failing eruption of the permanent dentition, and multiple supernumerary teeth. the first case of clavicular defects was reported by martin in 1765. another case with both clavicles and the skull affected was reported in 1871 by scheuthauer. in 1897 marie and sainton coined the descriptive title cleidocranial dysostosis. the condition was originally thought to involve bones of intramembranous origin only, namely the bones of the skull, clavicles and flat bones, hence the name cleidocranial. hesse was first to describe in detail the defects of dentition and jaws associated with cleidocranial dysostosis. yamamoto et al reported an individual with 63 supernumerary teeth. the gene for cleidocranial dysostosis has been mapped on the short arm of chromosome 6p21, core binding factor -1 (cbfa1). this disorder can be caused by mutation in the transcription factor cbfa1 (runx2). the cbfa1 gene controls differentiation of precursor cells into osteoblasts and is thus essential for membranous as well as endochondral bone formation, which may be related to delayed ossification of the skull, teeth, pelvis, and clavicles. yoshida et al used genotype-phenotype studies to show that skeletal growth and dental development could be related to the type of mutations in the runx2 gene. zheng et al concluded that the patients with cleidocranial dysostosis have altered endochondral ossification due to altered runx2 regulation of hypertrophic chondrocyte-specific genes during chondrocyte maturation.","{'answer_start': [163], 'text': ['clavicular aplasia or deficient formation of the clavicles, delayed and imperfect ossification of the cranium, moderately short stature, and a variety of other skeletal abnormalities. the oral manifestations are a delayed exfoliation of primary teeth, delayed or failing eruption of the permanent dentition, and multiple supernumerary teeth.']}",,pathology,"{'authors': ['Giampietro Farronato', 'Cinzia Maspero', 'Davide Farronato', 'Silvia Gioventù'], 'doi': 'https://doi.org/10.2319/111307-393.1', 'meta': 'Angle Orthod (2009) 79 (1): 178–185.', 'title': 'Orthodontic Treatment in a Patient with Cleidocranial Dysostosis'}",880f7ab7-f43c-43a4-84ea-2a7dda2c4a89
what was the objective of the angle classification?,"the term mesial drift is not new in either the thought or literature of dentistry. it means that the buccal teeth of the denture move in a forward direction. it is present, in a normal occlusion, as a natural physiological force, becoming effective as soon as the first permanent molars erupt and come into occlusion. its functions are to stimulate forward growth of the denture and take up the wear of the proximal contact points of the teeth. quite often, because of a disharmony of the forces of occlusion, mesial drift of the teeth becomes abnormal in its effect upon the denture. this paper will deal with the analysis, classification and treatment planning of abnormal mesial drift. the denture and take up the wear of the proximal contact points of the teeth. the first classifications of malocclusion were based solely on perverted tooth relationship. in 1899 the angle classification was introduced with the intention of relating the teeth and denture to the head as a whole. because tooth land marks, the first permanent molars, were used as indicators of three classes, the full import of this classification was not generally grasped that angle intended his classification to relate the arches to each other and to the cranium is proven in his paper, the upper first molar as a basis of diagnosis in orthodontia, published in at this time he pointed out that these teeth, for various reasons, may assume perverted position: within their own arches, and that the shifting of the six-year molars must be analyzed before they can be used as a basis for classification. this is one of the first writings dealing with the problem of mesial drift.","{'answer_start': [930], 'text': ['relating the teeth and denture to the head as a whole']}",,clinical,"{'authors': ['William B.

"regarding the properties stainless steel wires, what is the benefit from the 18/8 composition (18% chromium and 8% nickel)?","almost all orthodontic stainless steel wires are from the type 300 series, which implies that chromium contents account for 17% to 25%, and nickel 8% to 12%. these traditional stainless steel wires are often manufactured to an 18/8 composition, which indicates around 18% chromium and 8% nickel. this composition allows a chromium oxide layer to form and the alloy to remain in the austenite form, which leads to better corrosion resistance. the carbon content is intentionally kept at below 0.20% to reduce the formation of chromium carbides, which can lead to corrosion of the austenitic form of stainless steel. a study of australian and stainless steel wires found that a.j. wilcock australian wires were of the 18/8 stainless steel type but made no note of the carbon content. therefore, it could be assumed that the carbon content was within the 0.20% range of traditional stainless steel wires. semiquantitative elemental analysis of australian wires as reported in the present investigation indicates that the carbon content is well above the values reported for typical 18/8 stainless steel wire. although eds cannot be used to quantify light elements such as carbon, and thus the results should not be used on an absolute basis, data from this analysis reveal carbon content that is almost 10 times higher than the standard value. this increased carbon content could account for the rough, irregular, and excessively porous surfaces noted in our sem images of the wires. this may account for the impurities noted on the surfaces of australian wires in previous studies and may explain the propensity for higher grades of australian wires to not accept bends clinically.","{'answer_start': [313], 'text': ['allows a chromium oxide layer to form and the alloy to remain in the austenite form, which leads to better corrosion resistance']}",,materials,"{'authors': ['Brian M.

"in a growing child, which diagnostic finding would suggests an early intervention?","clinical implications of this study confirm the importance of the posteroanterior cephalogram in determining the presence of skeletal transverse discrepancy. if a child clinically presents with a posterior crossbite, it may be beneficial to include a posteroanterior cephalogram as part of the complete orthodontic records. the presence of a small effective maxillary to mandibular skeletal width ratio, ie, jl-jr:ag-ga, would suggest a skeletal component to the crossbite. this would have implications regarding early vs late treatment. a skeletal component to the posterior crossbite would be a reason for early intervention with the objective of providing skeletal correction while the child is still growing. once the patient reaches skeletal maturity the likelihood of obtaining true skeletal correction would be unlikely. on the other hand, if the review of the records reveals a larger or normal jl-jr:ag-ga, the posterior crossbite would be considered more dental in nature. this may possibly be a reason for postponing intervention to correct the posterior crossbite, because there is no skeletal component. this would save the expense as well as reduce treatment time by consolidating treatment into one phase, with correction of the crossbite at the time of full orthodontic appliance treatment. we currently do not have evidence of what would happen if we delay posterior crossbite treatment and this would be an area for future studies to explore. so how will the clinician know if the width/ratio values are small or large based on a single posteroanterior cephalogram? unlike the lateral cephalogram, little has been published regarding normal values of the transverse dimension obtained from posteroanterior cephalograms. because normal values are lacking, clinicians may be making treatment decisions based on subjective judgment rather than on rigorous scientific data. cortella et al studied the transverse development of the jaws. they generated norms for the posteroanterior cephalometric analysis using data from the bolton-brush growth study. this provided age specific means and standard deviations of cephalometric measurements for the distances jl-jr, ag-ga, and the corresponding differences. the current study showed similarities to the cortella et al study with regard to transverse dimension values. in the current study, the mean age (sd) for the nonposterior crossbite group was 10.4 (2.0). the closest corresponding age group in the cortella et al study was nine years. therefore, the nonposterior crossbite patients in the current study were compared with the nine-year-old group in the cortella et al study. for the cortella et al nine-year-old-age group, the following was found: mean (sd) effective maxillary width (jl-jr) = 60.6 (2.6), mean (sd) effective mandibular width (ag-ga) = 77.1 (3.4).","{'answer_start': [540], 'text': ['skeletal component to the posterior crossbite']}",,clinical,"{'authors': ['David Allen, DDS, MS', 'Joe Rebellato, DDS', 'Rose Sheats, DMD, MPH', 'Ana M.

"regarding craniofacial growth, what is the role of cartilage in endochondral ossification?","cranial base synchondroses are important growth centers of the craniofacial skeleton. this is especially true of the spheno-occipital synchondrosis because of its late ossification and major contribution to post natal cranial base growth. this serves as an important link between the development of the cranial vault and the facial skeleton. disturbance in their development causes abnormalities in the craniofacial region such as apert syndrome, crouzon syndrome, down syndrome, turner syndrome, craniosynostosis syndromes, cleidocranial dysplasia, and cleft palate. the synchondrosis develops from a cartilaginous template known as the chondrocranium which eventually is replaced by bone through endochondral ossification. the role of cartilage in endochondral ossification is obvious - it provides the anlagen for bone formation. rabie and co-workers showed that cartilage formation is closely related to bone formation in the mandibular condyle of growing rats. as the cartilage formation increases it will offer more opportunity for more bone to form because cartilage serves as a template onto which bone will form. corresponding to these results, the growth of the synchondroses must be modulated harmoniously by a cascade of events from various growth factors and regulatory factors that originate internally in the synchondroses. unlike the long bones, where many regulatory factors have already been identified, only a few studies were performed to investigate the factors regulating the growth of the spheno-occipital synchondrosis. this led us to look for sox9 expression during growth of the spheno-occipital synchondrosis due to its critical role in governing chondrocyte differentiation. sox9 has essential, nonredundant roles in specifying the commitment and differentiation of mesenchymal cells toward the chondrogenic lineage in all developing skeletal elements. furthermore, sox9 directly activates gene expression of type ii collagen, a major component of cartilaginous extracellular matrix that acts as an early and abundant main marker of the chondrocytes and forms the framework of cartilage matrix. therefore, we hypothesized that sox9 and type ii collagen expression could be induced by mechanical stimulation (tensile stress). thus, sox9 may play a role in the early differentiation of chondrocytes and increase the expression of type ii collagen, a major component of extracellular matrix, during cartilage growth in the spheno-occipital synchondrosis.","{'answer_start': [789], 'text': ['it provides the anlagen for bone formation']}",,growth,"{'authors': ['Teddy Cendekiawan', 'Ricky W.

"regarding the epidemiology of traumatic injuries to anterior teeth in children, which gender is most commonly affected?","the emergency treatment of a traumatically injured tooth occurs frequently in a general dental practice. traumatic injury to a permanent central incisor is a common occurrence in childhood and adolescence. the maxillary central incisors are the most affected tooth in both primary and permanent dentition injuries. the maxillary arch is involved in a higher percentage of trauma cases (95.72%). the most common cause of injuries is falls (67.34%). in the primary dentition, the most common type of injury is extrusive luxation (38.23%), and in the permanent dentition, fracture of enamel and dentin without pulpal involvement is most common (50.5%). the anterior teeth are both functionally and esthetically important. fracture of such teeth can affect the appearance of an individual and the ability to eat properly. epidemiological studies worldwide on traumatic injuries to anterior teeth in children show that the prevalence is relatively high, with more boys affected than girls. the incidence, predisposing factors, etiology, classification, clinical features, treatment modalities, and complications of traumatic injuries to anterior teeth in children have been studied. risk of incisor injury was reported to be greater for children who have a prognathic maxilla, a history of trauma, greater overjet, and mandibular anterior spacing. luxation injuries can be classified as intrusive, extrusive, and/or lateral; this categorization further facilitates the mode of splinting and repositioning used during treatment. luxation traumatic injuries affect the hard tissues and may involve periodontal tissues in severe cases. periodontal healing must be considered during treatment of traumatic injuries that result in total luxation of the teeth.","{'answer_start': [954], 'text': ['more boys affected than girls']}",,clinical,"{'authors': ['Ilker Görür a', 'Kaan Orhan b', 'Deniz C.

(figure 4a-b) between 13 and 45 years, maxillary arch length significantly (p < 0.05) in both males (x = 5.7 mm) and females (x 4.6 mm). similarly, arch length decreased between 8 and 15 years, by an average of 7.4 mm in males and 3.3 mm in females. the changes in arch length that occur through the life span of each individual are important to the clinician involved in the treatment of malocclusion. understanding the changes will not only help the clinician design an appropriate treatment plan, but will also help the clinician explain to the patient the changes that may occur during treatment as well as after retention is discontinued. the present findings indicate that the greatest incremental increases in both maxillary and mandibular total arch length occurred during the first two years of life. maxillary and mandibular arch lengths expressed increases at 13 years and 8 years, respectively. these changes are probably related to the eruption of the permanent incisors. following these ages, there were significant and consistent decreases in arch lengths mesial to the permanent first molars in both the maxillary and mandibular arches. these decreases continued until age 45. normally, the teeth do not change significantly in crown size except through interproximal attrition. as a result, the decrease in arch length is translated as an increase in the tooth size-arch length discrepancy, unless interproximal attrition keeps pace with the decrease in arch lengths. as stated earlier, between 13 and 45 years, maxillary arch length decreased an average of 5.7 mm in males and 4.6 mm in females and mandibular arch length decreased 5.0 mm in both sexes.","{'answer_start': [361], 'text': ['the increase in mandibular arch length was complete by 8 years']}",,clinical,"{'authors': ['Samir E.

"regarding smile attractiveness, how should the upper lip be positioned relative to the maxillary central incisors?","cephalometric evaluation indicates that two measurements in which the orthodontist who was most successful in improving his patients differed markedly from the other orthodontists. orthodontist #1 decreased the stomion-incision measurement. the other orthodontists increased it, this measurement is an indication of the amount of gingival tissue that shows when a person is smiling. a high percentage of the people seeking orthodontic treatment have more gingival tissue showing than hulsey demonstrated to be most pleasing. orthodontist #1 reduced the average amount of gingival tissue exposed when smiling. the other orthodontists increased the average amount of gingival tissue showing. orthodontist #1 also increased the angle of the long axis of the upper incisors to the na line. the other orthodontists decreased this angle. orthodontist #1 was most successful in maintaining good torque control of the upper incisors. it would seem that the reason orthodontist #1 was most successful in improving the appearance of his patients is because he improved the vertical lip-tooth relationship as advocated by utley, and he improved the inclination of the upper incisors. the results of this investigation support hulseys findings that, in the most attractive smiles, the upper lip rests at the height of the gingival margin of the maxillary central incisors. most of the patients whose smiles were rated four or five had a smiling lip line close to or at the gingival margin of the maxillary incisors. only patients who had been treated with an edgewise appliance were included in this investigation. there is an increasing amount of interest in the use of functional jaw orthopedics and crozat appliances and it would be interesting to determine if as high a quality smile can be developed with these treatment modalities. (1) in all four categories of evaluation (smile, maxillary incisor torque, protrusion, and profile) as rated by both groups of assessors (orthodontists and parents) there was a definite improvement in the average scores as a result of orthodontic treatment.

"regarding orthodontic treatment planning according to the soft tissue profile, when is extraction seen as beneficial?","in each set of plots, the intersection of the extraction and nonextraction regression lines provides an estimate of the point at which each panel would favor a reduction in lip procumbency. for the dentists, the extraction line crossed the nonextraction line at an initial lower-lip-to-e-plane measurement of about 3.9 mm; for laypersons, the lines crossed at 3.3 mm (figure 2). combining both panels' observations yielded a bend point of 3.5 mm behind the e-plane (figure 3). all observers' vas scores plotted against initial lip-protrusion to e-plane. solid line indicates nonextraction; interrupted line, extraction. nonextraction treatments had little perceived esthetic effect, regardless of initial procumbency. extraction was seen as the superior treatment when the lower lip was more protrusive than 3.5 mm behind the e-plane prior to treatment. in contemporary orthodontics, there is strong pressure to treat without extraction, even though the alternatives, ie, arch development and air-rotor stripping, are generally unproven. this failure to deliver evidence-based treatment runs contrary to powerful trends in dentistry as a whole. the present study was designed to address this apparent contradiction. patients exhibiting crowding and bimaxillary protrusion are susceptible to extraction treatment and might be expected to demonstrate more profile improvement than their flatter counterparts, for whom a profile change is not sought. retrospective comparison of these 2 alternatives might favor extraction treatment merely because of this susceptibility bias. in previous investigations, discriminant analysis has been used to identify comparable samples to provide a valid estimate of the differential effect of various treatment alternatives. in the present study there was no attempt to select comparable extraction and nonextraction samples. rather, our goal was to gather a sample with a wide range of initial facial profiles. although we made no attempt to achieve parity, both the extraction and nonextraction samples demonstrated nearly identical average lip procumbancies prior to treatment (lower lip to e-plane of 0.18 mm and 0.13 mm, respectively; table 4). thus, the profiles but perhaps not the rest of the dentofacial complex demonstrated minimal susceptibility bias and thus should support a useful between-treatment comparison.","{'answer_start': [718], 'text': ['extraction was seen as the superior treatment when the lower lip was more protrusive than 3.5 mm behind the e-plane prior to treatment']}",,clinical,"{'authors': ['S.

"in patients with transmigrated canines, what is the most common dental anomaly?","this case shows several unusual features. transmigrated canines are rare. however, this is the first case where transmigration of a lateral incisor has been recorded. furthermore, a supplemental premolar had erupted into the arch, adjacent to the retained deciduous canine. it is not unusual for ectopic mandibular canines to be associated with an however, these are usually of abnormal shape and fail to erupt. in their review of the literature, shapira and reviewed 73 cases of transmigrated canines. seven cases (9.5%) exhibited hypodontia while five cases (7%) with odontomes were found. in three of these (4%), both anomalies were present. suggests odontomata as a possible cause of aberrant eruption. ectopic maxillary canines are associated with hypodontia, but ectopic mandibular canines are associated with both hypoand hyperdontia. one explanation may be that the control of dental lamina proliferation is regulated differently in the maxillary and mandibular arches. camilleri and scerri presented a series of five transmigrated canines, of which four exhibited one or more inheritable dental anomaly. the most common anomaly was ectopic eruption of other teeth, namely the maxillary canines, though one case also had ectopic lower second premolars. the presence of supernumerary teeth together with canine-lateral incisor transmigration of these teeth is consistent with the theory that several developmental disorders have a common, hereditary etiology, although no other family member exhibited any similar dental anomaly. a further unusual feature is that the crown of the mesial tooth is on the lingual side of the arch. transmigrated teeth are usually quoted as being buccal. the intraosseous stage of tooth eruption involves figures 2a,b. standard and true occlusal views of the mandible showing the position of the crowns. bone resorption to form an eruption pathway and bone formation, to move the tooth into the eruption pathway. these events are regulated by the dental follicle which determines the direction and timing of tooth eruption. loss of synchronization of osteoblast-osteoclast signaling may lead to complications. the overall delay of eruption and ankylosis of teeth associated with cases of ectopic eruption may point to a localized defect in osteoclast or osteoblast function. it is not surprising that eruption anomalies may affect more than one type of tooth. because the eruption process is common to all teeth, it is unlikely that the mechanisms of eruption of different teeth are due to the action of different genes. therefore, a defect in the eruption process may reasonably be expected to affect all teeth to some degree. variations in temporal and spatial gene expression of the mutant genes as well as regional differences in regulation may account for the range of eruption anomalies seen.","{'answer_start': [1141], 'text': ['ectopic eruption of other teeth, namely the maxillary canine']}",,pathology,"{'authors': ['Simon Camilleri'], 'doi': 'https://doi.org/10.2319/071006-285', 'meta': 'Angle Orthod (2007) 77 (4): 742–744.', 'title': 'Double Transmigration and Hyperdontia'}",b369b039-2fef-4695-9899-0fa429448213
"for dolychocephalic with a backward-rotating mandible and a high mp-sn angle, does open bite malocclusion tend to get better or worse during growth?","similarly, if high mp-sn angles result from relatively large amounts of vertical alveolar growth, the vertical length of the upper and lower molars, as well as the anterior dental height, should be greater. conversely, if low mp-sn angles result from forward rotation with relatively less vertical alveolar growth, the alveolar measurements should be less in these cases. in table iv these anticipated results are found. the incisal vertical relationships are also as predicted. the backward-rotating high mp-sn angle case has a tendency toward open bite in spite of the fact that the maxillary incisor is already markedly longer. these people do not necessarily have short upper lips, but they do have longer maxillary alveolar processes. the forward-rotating mp-sn angle case has a tendency toward deep overbite despite the fact that the maxillary incisor is already shorter. such overbites or open bites are skeletal in nature and can be expected to get worse with continuance of the growth pattern already manifest (figs. 2 and 3). the anteroposterior positioning of teeth components can logically be anticipated to affect mandibular rotation. as teeth or skeletal parts are located posteriorly, the mpsn angle can be expected to increase. conversely, lov mp-sn angles should be associated with more anterior placement of these component parts. table ii reveals just such relationships. riemean sna of 82 degrees was derived from subjects with good occlusions. patients with marked skeletal variation will possess sna values characteristic of their growth patterns. the maxillary first molar was also situated more posteriorly in high mp-sn cases and more anteriorly in low mp-sn cases (table ii). this indicates that the denture, as well as the skeletal base, is in a characteristic anteroposterior position relative to the mp-sn angle or growth pattern present. it is logically anticipated that backward rotating mandibles increase facial height and therefore elongate the facial musculature. as muscles are elongated, the passive stretch tension increases. this would be expected to cause the","{'answer_start': [934], 'text': ['can be expected to get worse with continuance of the growth pattern already manifest']}",,growth,"{'authors': ['JOHN R.

"in patients with mixed dentition and an impacted permanent canine, which procedure can aid the eruption an impacted canine?","lindqvist lists solutions to the problem of missing second premolar. one option is to maintain the deciduous teeth until they are lost by exfoliation, extraction due to caries, root resorption, ankylosis, or infraocclusion. after growth ceases, prosthetic replacement can follow. autotransplantation and orthodontic space closure are also alternatives. another option is planned extraction of the deciduous second molars to allow for spontaneous space closure. it may be necessary to use orthodontic appliances to complete the space closure. the prevalence of impacted maxillary canines is 1 2% in the general population. the etiology of impaction is multifactorial. some of the common causes are genetic predisposition, anomalies in maxillary lateral incisors, and inadequate arch space. regardless of the cause of the impaction, early treatment to prevent damage to the maxillary lateral incisor is recommended. ericson and kurol14 showed that the amount of resorption noted using computed tomography scans is greater than that observed with routine radiographic imaging. ericson and kurol recommended early extraction of the primary canine to aid spontaneous eruption of the impacted permanent canine. many authors have discussed surgical exposure and orthodontic movement at length. pulpal and periodontal consequences are minimal. in some instances, extraction of the impacted tooth is necessary. this is usually followed by prosthetic replacement. caucasian girl of 10 years three months old presented for an orthodontic consultation. her family dentist had referred her for possible early orthodontic intervention. the patient reported no chief complaint. the patient's medical history was noncontributory. no signs or symptoms of temporomandibular joint dysfunction were noted. initial orthodontic records demonstrated a class i mixed dentition malocclusion with moderate maxillary and mandibular arch crowding and agenesis of teeth 15, 35, and 45 (figure 1). analysis of the study models and intraoral photographs showed an increased overbite and tight overjet. maxillary incisors were slightly retruded. dental midlines were coincident. no crossbites were present. no extraoral or intraoral pathology was present. no gross asymmetries were noted. facial photographs revealed a mesocephalic appearance. the patient had a convex profile. lip competence at repose was noted. the patient's upper lip was short, and her mentolabial fold was shallow.","{'answer_start': [1110], 'text': ['extraction of the primary canine']}",,clinical,"{'authors': ['Maryam Saiar, DDS', 'Joe Rebellato, DDS'], 'doi': 'https://doi.org/10.1043/0003-3219(2004)074<0568:MICWCA>2.0.CO;2', 'meta': 'Angle Orthod (2004) 74 (4): 568–575.', 'title': 'Maxillary Impacted Canine with Congenitally Absent Premolars'}",fcab24dc-e4a7-4467-9ccb-8ee41f2bbc3c
"in patients affected by a mild form of hemifacial microsomia, which therapy is indicated after puberty?","deficiencies in growth of 1 or both condyles of the mandible may result from multiple causes. condylar fractures at an early age may affect growth centers. congenital deformities, such as goldenhar's syndrome, nager's syndrome, craniofacial scoliosis, and pierre robin syndrome, may present mandibular hypoplasia with varying degrees of severity. hemifacial microsomia is a relatively common facial malformation, second in frequency only to clefts of the lip and palate. in this group of hypoplasias the mandibular deficiency may be associated with microtia, facial asymmetry, deviation of the chin to the affected side, and hypoplasia of the soft tissues. the unilateral deficiency in mandibular growth, including its associated soft tissues and masticatory muscles, alters symmetrical vertical growth of the maxilla and may also alter the position of the orbit. patients with branchial arch dysplasias characteristically show hypogenesis or agenesis of the condylar process and mandible. as a result, the facial deformities often become worse during growth. in growing patients, orthopedic treatment with functional appliances is often indicated. after pubertal growth, mild deformities can be corrected with orthodontic treatment, genioplasty, or unilateral mandibular augmentation, while more severe cases may require simultaneous mandibular and maxillary surgery. early surgical intervention with autogenous costochondral grafting may be indicated for patients with severe deformities. gradual traction on living tissues can create stresses that will stimulate and maintain regeneration and active growth of tissue structure. under the proper conditions, cells associated with the free surfaces of bone can differentiate into osteogenic or chondrogenic cells needed for repair or growth. the process of generating new bone by stretching was introduced by ilizarov and is called distraction osteogenesis. based on experimental and clinical studies over 35 years, he suggested that distraction osteogenesis could be used to treat 17 types of injuries or orthopedic diseases. gradual bone lengthening by distraction has been a standard procedure for treating endochondral bones of the hands and feet. synder et al described the first use of distraction osteogenesis in the canine mandible. sawaki reported distraction osteogenesis in sheep. michieli and miotti were able to lengthen the dog mandible using an intraoral distraction device attached to the mandibular dentition. other investigators have also reported successful experimental studies of mandibular lengthening by distraction osteogenesis. in 1992, mccarthy et al reported the first clinical cases of mandibular lengthening by gradual distraction. molina et al reported mandibular elongation by distraction as a farewell to major osteotomies. distraction techniques have been used in the human facial bone area for the past 10 years. the biomechanical effects of mandibular lengthening in 32 rabbits have been shown on a cellular and histological level. techniques and equipment are improving and intraoral osteogenic distraction devices have recently been developed and used.","{'answer_start': [1211], 'text': ['orthodontic treatment, genioplasty, or unilateral mandibular augmentation']}",,pathology,"{'authors': ['Azita Tehranchi, DMD', 'Hossein Behnia, DMD'], 'doi': 'https://doi.org/10.1043/0003-3219(2000)070<0165:TOMABD>2.0.CO;2', 'meta': 'Angle Orthod (2000) 70 (2): 165–174.', 'title': 'Treatment of Mandibular Asymmetry by Distraction Osteogenesis and Orthodontics: A Report of Four Cases'}",02260f09-9187-46b9-9fc4-4f4f0d30093a
"regarding biomechanics of orthodontic tooth movement, what movement occurs when the center of rotation and center of resistance are at the same point?","pure rotation or tipping occurs when the center of rotation and center of resistance are at the same point. pure translation occurs when the center of rotation is at infinity. pure rotation requires a couple or two opposite and equal forces. pure translation requires a single force acting through the center of resistance or a single force not through the center of resistance but with a properly balanced couple. a single force not acting through the center of resistance and without a couple creates translation and rotation. the center of resistance translates but, in addition, the body will rotate about the center of resistance. there also occurs an instantaneous center of rotation for the system somewhere between infinity and the center of resistance. this center of rotation is related to the perpendicular distance between the force vector and the center resistance. the framework of the attachment mechanism can be adjusted by extension arms so that when the force is applied, it, in effect, will be traveling through the center of resistance or at any distance from it that is desired. the facebow is a good example of this method. while the framework of the facebow may take on many designs and points of attachment to the tooth, the effect on the dental unit is ultimately only related to the shortest perpendicular distance between the force vector and the center of resistance. 1 1 fundamental physics teaches that the shortest perpendicular distance between a force vector and the center of resistance of a body determines the center of rotation. figure 5 illustrates these principles as they apply to headgear systems. regardless of the design of the facebow or j hook, the body (tooth) reacts to the force system of the headgear that is computed by figuring the shortest perpendicular distance from the force vector to the center of resistance. this distance dictates how the tooth moves and, more specifically, where the instantaneous center of rotation will be (fig. 6).","{'answer_start': [0], 'text': ['pure rotation or tipping']}",,biomechanics,"{'authors': ['FRANK W.

"regarding the pre-surgical preparation of orthognathic surgery, what should be done about impacted third molars prior to le fort i?","the presence of maxillary third molars influenced the transverse angulation of the posterior vertical cut of le fort i. impacted maxillary third molars have been proposed as a factor in the increased incidence of intraoperative maxillary unfavorable fracture. it has been decided that third molars should be removed before orthognathic surgery at a minimum of 6 months before le fort i osteotomy, because it will take time for the maxillary bone to adequately heal. in this case, the upper second molars were revealed to be ectopically erupted, and we recognized that removal of second molars could be justified with the expectation of their satisfactory replacement by third molars. autotransplantation is one of the options available for the treatment of a missing tooth when a donor tooth is available. the recipient site may be an extraction socket or a surgically prepared site. autotransplantation of a third molar for replacement of the missing teeth is sometimes a suitable alternative to prosthetic treatment. fully developed third molars in this case are potential candidates in the absence of other suitable donor teeth. the success rate has been reported to be excellent if the donor teeth were transplanted before root formation was completed.9 teeth with one-third to three-quarter root formation are most frequently transplanted clinically. on the other hand, it has been reported that autotransplantation is a reliable method with a good prognosis for donor teeth with both open and closed apices if teeth with closed apices are endodontically treated. the denuded root surface was expected to be subject to ankylosis or root resorption because of the lack of periodontal membrane. andreasen concluded that the presence of an intact and viable periodontal ligament (pdl) on the root surface is the most important factor in ensuring healing without resorption. in this case, no signs of ankylosis and resorption were evident after the transplantation. essentially, root canal treatment was employed with calcium hydroxide medication because of its high ph, which provides an antimicrobial effect and stimulates the healing process.","{'answer_start': [285], 'text': ['third molars should be removed before orthognathic surgery at a minimum of 6 months before le fort i osteotomy']}",,clinical,"{'authors': ['Toru Kitahara', 'Akihiko Nakasima', 'Yuji Shiratsuchi'], 'doi': 'https://doi.org/10.2319/022008-103.1', 'meta': 'Angle Orthod (2009) 79 (2): 401–406.', 'title': 'Orthognathic Treatment with Autotransplantation of Impacted Maxillary Third Molar'}",da44072c-e472-4d81-858b-7b18aad0ab09
"regarding mouth breathers, what are the theorized changes in mandible and tongue posture?","mouthbreathing is said to be the result of nasorespiratory impairment. a number of theories concerning the undesirable facial growth and dental malocclusion associated with mouthbreathing have been suggested. an impaired nasal airway may result in the alteration of normal air currents and pressures with the oral airstream interfering with normal palatal nasal airway impairment may also result in a modification of the posture of the head and neck, producing a dorsal and caudal restraint on facial development. current theory suggests that mouthbreathing results in changes in tongue posture and mandibular position. a mouthbreather lowers his or her mandible and frequently positions the tongue in a low forward plane. in this position the tongue does not offset the forces of the cheeks and lips upon the maxilla. efforts to define mouthbreathing have led to an emphasis on improving assessment and definition of nasal airway impairment. warren and hairfield, et al, using a pressure flow technique to estimate nasal cross-sectional area and inductive plethysmography to assess nasal-oral breathing, reported that adult nasal airway size was generally related to nasal-oral breathing. they also noted that approximately 12% of their sample were habitual mouthbreathers despite having an adequate nasal airway. using similar technology warren, hairfield, and dalston examined nasal patency and nasal-oral breathing in a sample of 102 children. they reported that nasal cross-sectional area increased with age across years 6 to 14. surprisingly, the percentage of children who were primarily nasal vs oral breathers was approximately equal until age 8. after 8 years of age most children were classified as nasal breathers.","{'answer_start': [636], 'text': ['lowers his or her mandible and frequently positions the tongue in a low forward plane']}",,clinical,"{'authors': ['Alan M.

"in nigerian children with a flush terminal plane, what is the most likely molar relationship in the permanent dentition?","according to bishara et al, the final molar occlusion is dependent on a number of dental and facial skeletal changes, both genetic and environmental, that interact to achieve, or not achieve normal occlusion. the distribution of angle molar classification and other occlusal variables in this study that resulted from the time of initial examination (time 1) is consistent with earlier reports in epidemiological and clinical studies among nigerians. the findings in this present investigation indicated that if the initial occlusion in the primary dentition is a flush terminal plane (class i) or mesial step (class ii), a majority of the subjects will develop into angle class i in the permanent dentition. this is consistent with the findings of bishara et al. meanwhile, the only subject in this study initially having distal step relationship of the second deciduous molars resulted in a normal angle class i molar relationship. this observation deserves a good follow-up of the subject to complete the permanent dentition so as to ascertain any possible change of this molar relationship into a class ii relationship. it is generally accepted the distal step relationship of the second deciduous molars usually results in a distocclusion (class ii) molar relationship in the permanent dentition. there was no consistent gender difference observed in the permanent molar relationship in this study. again, this is consistent with previous studies in nigerian children showing no defined gender bias for the molar occlusions. overbite and overjet patterns of the subjects at the two periods of examination are consistent with nigerian literature on occlusions in the deciduous and permanent dentitions. in the present study, only one of the occlusal variables (spacing of the arches) did not correlate positively between the primary and early mixed dentition stages. this could be due to the fact that the generalized spaces recorded in the deciduous (primary) dentitions were utilized for the eruption of the larger permanent incisors in the early mixed dentition. while it should be noted that the changes in the other four occlusal features were significantly positively correlated, it is worth noting also that all the positively significant correlations (r) were below 0.7. one of the main purposes of correlating the variables between the deciduous and early mixed dentition stages is to possibly predict the occlusion in the permanent dentition. correlations below 0.7 or r = 0.8 do not give an accurate prediction for individuals. therefore, although these correlations in this nigerian study are significant and could be a guide, they do not guarantee an accurate prediction of the occlusal features in the permanent dentition. the current finding is in agreement with the findings of bishara et al. a follow-up of these subjects is being planned to ascertain their definitive occlusal status in the full permanent dentition stage when the children would have been in secondary school. the idea of having at least one growth and development study center in nigeria is to be advocated as this will help in having more longitudinal studies that can also guarantee larger sample sizes.","{'answer_start': [622], 'text': ['a majority of the subjects will develop into angle class i in the permanent dentition']}",,growth,"{'authors': ['Chukwudi Ochi Onyeaso', 'Michael Chukwudi Isiekwe'], 'doi': 'https://doi.org/10.2319/021207-66.1', 'meta': 'Angle Orthod (2008) 78 (1): 64–69.', 'title': 'Occlusal Changes from Primary to Mixed Dentitions in Nigerian Children'}",8e11f6a9-4d96-4023-922c-6fb110ad04a0
"regarding the soft tissue changes following orthognathic surgery, how did the alar base width change after bimaxillary surgery?","the presurgical cephalometric measurements indicated a skeletal class iii malocclusion due to a retrusive maxilla combined with a protrusive mandible. maxillary advancement and mandibular set-back surgery balanced the maxillomandibular relationship into a skeletal class i within the normal range (table 1). vertical and horizontal changes in the maxilla (a point and pns) and the mandible (b point) indicate posterior impaction of the maxilla along with advancement and mandibular set back in both males and females (table 2). the nose/alar width was increased by a mean of 2.2 0.93 mm (for both males and females) and the alar base width by 1.24 0.93 mm (for both males and females) after bimaxillary surgery (p < .001). the nostril apex width and length of the long nostril axis were significantly larger, while the length of the short nostril axis and nasal tip protrusion were significantly lower (p < .001) after surgery. there were no significant changes in the nasal bridge length. the changes were similar in both genders (table 3). female patients with a narrow nose tended to be more susceptible to nasal changes. for males, the nose/alar width increased similarly in the narrow-nose (n = 5) and broad-nose groups (n = 5). however, for the females, the widening of the alar width in the narrow-nose group was significantly higher than that of the broad-nose group (p < .05). the widening of the alar base width was similar between the narrow-nose and broad-nose groups regardless of gender (table 4).","{'answer_start': [620], 'text': ['the alar base width by 1.24 0.93 mm (for both males and females)']}",,clinical,"{'authors': ['Chooryung Chung', 'Yebert Lee', 'Kwang-Ho Park', 'Sun-Hyung Park', 'Young-Chel Park', 'Kyung-Ho Kim'], 'doi': 'https://doi.org/10.2319/041207-186.1', 'meta': 'Angle Orthod (2008) 78 (3): 427–432.', 'title': 'Nasal Changes after Surgical Correction of Skeletal Class III Malocclusion in Koreans'}",9ac1001b-6b51-42a2-ae64-92a314e4cd32
"according to the available evidence, what is the effect of primary canine extraction on the eruption of palatally displaced canines (pdc)?","objective: to determine whether the successful management of palatally displaced permanent canines (pdcs) can be achieved by the interceptive extraction of primary maxillary canines. materials and methods: digital databases (medline, scopus, web of science, and cochrane) were searched to retrieve articles published from 1952 to april 2016. the university librarian developed search strategies for each database. two calibrated reviewers independently reviewed potentially related titles and abstracts. papers meeting the inclusion and exclusion criteria were read in full. the selected articles were evaluated and scored according to methodological quality criteria. results: four randomized clinical trials (rcts) were included in the systematic review. compared with two older studies, two more recent rcts were found to have better study designs, were better conducted, and involved better reporting of the results. the included studies compared intervention groups (children with pdcs undergoing extraction of primary canines) with controls (subjects with pdcs but no primary canine extractions). in three of the four studies, the interceptive extraction of primary canines facilitated eruption of pdcs in more than 65% of cases. overall, the intervention groups had a markedly higher incidence of successful eruption of pdcs (50% 69%) compared with the control groups (36% 42%). conclusions: based on the available evidence, it is reasonable to conclude that eruption of pdcs can be facilitated by extraction of primary canines. however, further high-quality, randomized clinical trials are warranted in other population groups. it is hoped that this study will help orthodontists make evidence-based decisions about clinically managing pdcs. permanent canines are the secondmost commonly impacted teeth after third molars, and almost 1% 3% of the population has been found to have impacted maxillary canines. in about 85% of cases with impaction, maxillary canines are palatally displaced. genetic predisposition and several other factors are implicated in the etiology of palatally displaced maxillary canines (pdcs). the management of these clinical problems may require interdisciplinary approaches in addition to substantial participation by orthodontists. complications resulting from pdcs include loss of space in the dental arch, displacement and resorption of adjacent roots, and formation of cysts in rare cases. moreover, patients may undergo traumatic surgical exposure of pdcs, followed by prolonged and costly fixed orthodontic treatment. the management of pdcs may require surgically exposing the canine and applying a fixed orthodontic appliance to guide it into appropriate occlusion or extracting the primary canine to provide space for its successor to eliminate or minimize developing malocclusion, an approach called interceptive orthodontics. early interceptive treatment can lessen the degree of developing malocclusion and thus decrease the need for future orthodontic treatment of permanent teeth.10 it can also minimize the time and cost of treatment in addition to improving self-esteem and patient satisfaction.","{'answer_start': [1466], 'text': ['eruption of pdcs can be facilitated by extraction of primary canines']}",,clinical,"{'authors': ['Naif N.

"during the intermediate stage of orthodontic treatment, which type of wire becomes more advantageous?","having summarized the state of the art of archwires over the last 50 years, lets explore how they complement and supplement one another in everyday practice by applying the concepts of elastic property ratios. in this regard, some reference to the strength, stiffness, and range would be appropriate as a function of the different stages of treatment (figure 8). during the initial stage of treatment, where initial leveling and alignment are desired, great range and light forces are sought. by referencing elastic property ratios of strength, stiffness, and range, two principal types of wires are suggested: either a multistranded stainless steel wire or a nitinol-type wire. the former capitalizes on conventional variable cross-section orthodontics, which was tabulated many years ago in an orthodontic textbook by dr. raymond thurow. the latter makes use of variable modulus orthodontics in which three of the four principal alloys in use today have different stiffnesses for the same shape and size of archwire. as treatment progresses into the intermediate stage, beta-titanium alloys become advantageous as their formability, springback, range, and modest forces per unit deactivation become favorable. larger sizes of nitinol can still be useful here, however, if an 0.022 inch slot is employed. if sliding mechanics are required, undersized stainless steel wires may be used. as the orthodontic patient progresses to the final stage of treatment wherein more arch, stability and small tooth movements are required, wires having substantial stiffnesses but limited ranges are acceptable. consequently, large gauges of beta-titanium or stainless steel wires may be used to maintain arch form while making small rotational, translational, or tipping motions. exactly which alloy is used here depends on the details of the case that is, whether it is more important to have more range, as afforded by a beta-titanium wire, or more stiffness, as afforded by a stainless steel wire.","{'answer_start': [1072], 'text': ['beta-titanium alloys']}",,materials,"{'authors': ['Robert P.

"regarding soft tissue changes with aging, what changes occur in upper lip length from 19 to 60 years?","the aging process affects the skin, soft tissues, and structural support tissues. many of the facial manifestations of aging reflect the combined effects of gravity, progressive bone remodeling, decreased tissue elasticity and atrophy, and the loss of facial fullness. therefore, it is important to consider the effect of age on the smile. in this study, the upper lip length increased by 2.25 mm in men and by 0.49 mm in women as age increased from 19 years to 60 years. the mean values for all age groups were greater for men; therefore, significant differences were found only between the men in groups 1 and 3 (p=.020) and groups 1 and 4 (p=.001). we also found that, beginning at the age of 25 years, there was a significant difference in the upper lip length between men and women (between groups 2, 3, and 4). consistent with our study, chetan et al. reported that upper lip length increased with age in males and females from 16 years to 55 years, with higher mean values for males in all age groups. the authors attributed this finding to the loss of resting muscle tone, increased flaccidity, and redundancy. miron et al. also verified the occurrence of gender dimorphism in most of their variables and reported that the upper lip length was 3 mm shorter in women than in men (p<.01). complementing the study of the upper lip, the present research evaluated the lip commissure height and concluded that this value gradually increased with age in both genders. in participants aged older than 25 years, statistically significant differences in relation to gender dimorphism were found between groups 2, 3, and 4 (p<.001) for both right and left lip commissure height. dickens et al. also observed an increase in the lip commissure height over time, with the mean values for all age groups greater among men than women, which is in accordance with our study. however, these authors did not identify significant differences related to gender dimorphism.","{'answer_start': [376], 'text': ['increased by 2.25 mm in men and by 0.49 mm in women']}",,clinical,"{'authors': ['Stephanie Drummond', 'Jonas Capelli, Jr'], 'doi': 'https://doi.org/10.2319/042515-284.1', 'meta': 'Angle Orthod (2016) 86 (4): 631–637.', 'title': 'Incisor display during speech and smile: Age and gender correlations'}",6b75a0f6-cbae-4f8b-9307-41582701af51

"concerning craniofacial growth, when does the anterior wall of the cranial base (sella turcica) stabilize?","this systematic review aimed to analyze published studies that evaluated growth of s-ba and to evaluate their methodological quality. the results indicated that s-ba is not a stable structure during craniofacial growth, and changes in s-ba are primarily due to growth activity at the spheno-occipital synchondrosis, as well as sutural growth (eg, occipitomastoid changes) and cortical drift, in which bone is resorbed and deposited along the superior and inferior surfaces of the basicranium. with no definitive agreement on timing of the cessation of growth and closure of the spheno-occipital synchondrosis, s-ba growth was reported to continue to grow even by small increments into adulthood and beyond. proportional growth was reported; differential growth rates were also seen. the more significant differential growth rates tended to correlate with pubertal growth spurts and growth potential. a calculated length change over a 9-year period (ages 6 15) was shown. all these studies supported this relationship between s-ba length increase with activity of the spheno-occipital synchondrosis, since their study periods took place before the estimated closure of the synchondrosis at about age 11 18, based on laminagraphy, autopsy, and serial sections. bjork showed dorsal elongation of the cranial base due to endochondral growth at the clivus. in reference to direction of growth change, basion was shown to move backward and downward, with an additional point measured in the general area of basion, occipital condyle point (bolton), also showing downward and backward movement. the anterior reference point for s-ba, sella, was shown to move down and back as well (figure 2). although both basion and sella were displaced in the same direction, these changes seemed to be due to different mechanisms. movement of basion can be attributed to synchondrosis growth, whereas movement of sella can be attributed to eccentric growth of the sella turcica which remains stable at its anterior wall after around age 7. intrinsic growth of sella turcica was also shown in a previous systematic review by afrand et al. as reported by enlow, development of the endocranium also occurs by deposition on the outside and resorption from the inside, also referred to as cortical drift. this can also explain small changes in location of landmarks from longitudinal cephalograms. bjork also reported parallel lowering of the foramen magnum.","{'answer_start': [2000], 'text': ['after around age 7']}",,growth,"{'authors': ['Kris Currie', 'Dena Sawchuk', 'Humam Saltaji', 'Heesoo Oh', 'Carlos Flores-Mir', 'Manuel Lagravere'], 'doi': 'https://doi.org/10.2319/032717-218.1', 'meta': 'Angle Orthod (2017) 87 (6): 897–910.', 'title': 'Posterior cranial base natural growth and development: A systematic review'}",4d506530-6801-4f5a-a2f0-1d20c351dbe8

why should orthodontic treatment be avoided in patients with uncontrolled diabetes?,"patients with type 1 dm are those who present greater susceptibility to microvascular alterations. studies related to dental movement and diabetes show that the disease promotes retarded osseous regeneration, weakening of the periodontal ligament, microangiopathies in the gingival area, and larger and more severe bone gaps on the alveolar walls. the reduced new-bone formation capacity is owing to the apoptosis of fibroblastic and osteoblastic cells in diabetic individuals. case reports have been published on life-threatening deep neck infections from periodontal abscess and fatal maxillary ulcers in patients with dm. in the latter, the ulcers were not superficial but represented deep granulomatous disease. however, the extent to which such incidents are a part of the broader spectrum of infection in people with diabetes has not yet been established and shows the importance of the diagnosis of the disease. the presented case clearly illustrates several complications of dm, such as the high susceptibility to infection, connective tissue destruction, microvascular alterations, and difficulties in healingand exaggerated inflammatory response. dentists play an important role in identifying patients who may have diabetes mellitus by recognizing oral manifestations of the disease and systemic signs and symptoms. the oral cavity may show the first signs or symptoms of an undiagnosed or poorly controlled diabetic condition. other findings characteristic of dm are accelerated tooth eruption until 10 years of age, greater gingival bleeding when probing and a higher prevalence of caries. type 1 diabetes develops when the patient is still a child, usually diagnosed only at the end of adolescence, and can affect the patient's skeletal maturation because diabetic patients have less skeletal maturation when compared with normal patients. glycemic control in dm management is a key to reducing the impact of acute oral infections and microvascular complications, and for diabetes patients under good medical control, all dental procedures can be performed. a diabetes control and complications trial study revealed that long-term complications can be reduced by 54% to 76% if dm is managed properly, and systemic and oral complications are more likely the longer the disease lasts and remains out of control. orthodontic treatment should be avoided in patients with poorly controlled type 1 dm because these individuals are particularly susceptible to periodontal breakdown. there is more gingival inflammation even in well-controlled diabetic patients, probably owing to the impaired neutrophil function. prior to commencing treatment, patients should be informed about the greater propensity for gingival inflammation when fixed appliances are planned. therefore, it is important to maintain good oral hygiene to prevent periodontal breakdown progression, especially in type 1 diabetes patients, and such attention with hygiene should be maintained throughout the entire treatment. once the disease is under control, orthodontic treatment can resume. however, in our case, a tooth-borne expander could have been used instead of a haas appliance, only to have an additional care.","{'answer_start': [2417], 'text': ['these individuals are particularly susceptible to periodontal breakdown']}",,pathology,"{'authors': ['Luiz Guilherme Martins Maia', 'André da Costa Monini', 'Helder Baldi Jacob', 'Luiz Gonzaga Gandini Jr'], 'doi': 'https://doi.org/10.2319/031110-141.1', 'meta': 'Angle Orthod (2011) 81 (3): 546–550.', 'title': 'Maxillary ulceration resulting from using a rapid maxillary expander in a diabetic patient'}",d79850bd-65f3-4c82-85c2-f0302dba2175
"regarding biomechanics of orthodontic tooth movement, what movement occurs when the center of rotation is at infinity?","pure rotation or tipping occurs when the center of rotation and center of resistance are at the same point. pure translation occurs when the center of rotation is at infinity. pure rotation requires a couple or two opposite and equal forces. pure translation requires a single force acting through the center of resistance or a single force not through the center of resistance but with a properly balanced couple. a single force not acting through the center of resistance and without a couple creates translation and rotation. the center of resistance translates but, in addition, the body will rotate about the center of resistance. there also occurs an instantaneous center of rotation for the system somewhere between infinity and the center of resistance. this center of rotation is related to the perpendicular distance between the force vector and the center resistance. the framework of the attachment mechanism can be adjusted by extension arms so that when the force is applied, it, in effect, will be traveling through the center of resistance or at any distance from it that is desired. the facebow is a good example of this method. while the framework of the facebow may take on many designs and points of attachment to the tooth, the effect on the dental unit is ultimately only related to the shortest perpendicular distance between the force vector and the center of resistance. 1 1 fundamental physics teaches that the shortest perpendicular distance between a force vector and the center of resistance of a body determines the center of rotation. figure 5 illustrates these principles as they apply to headgear systems. regardless of the design of the facebow or j hook, the body (tooth) reacts to the force system of the headgear that is computed by figuring the shortest perpendicular distance from the force vector to the center of resistance. this distance dictates how the tooth moves and, more specifically, where the instantaneous center of rotation will be (fig. 6).","{'answer_start': [108], 'text': ['pure translation']}",,biomechanics,"{'authors': ['FRANK W.

"regarding three dimensional analysis, what is roll?","mandibular prognathism is highly prevalent in asians and is usually accompanied by facial asymmetry. when skeletal disharmony is present, the dentition migrates not only anteroposteriorly and vertically but also transversely to achieve occlusal function. for patients with facial asymmetry, accurate diagnosis and surgical treatment planning and adequate removal of transverse dental compensations in the maxillary and mandibular arches is a requisite for successful management of facial asymmetry. traditionally, two-dimensional (2d) cephalometric radiographs, such as posteroanterior (pa) cephalograms and submentovertex radiographs, have been essential tools for evaluating facial asymmetry. in 2003, kusayama et al. showed a high correlation between skeletal asymmetry and dental compensation by analyzing pa radiographs and three-dimensional (3d) dental models. shigefuji et al. also reported greater molar axis changes in the deviated side than in the nondeviated side. previous studies revealed several characteristics of transverse dental compensations and their relationship with skeletal facial asymmetry but failed to quantify the severity of deviation due to the lack of a control group. in addition, 2d modalities face limitations caused by image magnification, distortion, and superimposition of skeletal structures. when using pa images, it is easy to overestimate or underestimate the severity of facial asymmetry. gateno et al. described significant distortion of the shape and size of the mandible in roll and yaw asymmetries. currently, diagnosis and treatment planning of facial asymmetry can be performed through quantitative measurement of 3d cone-beam computed tomography (cbct) images. mandibular asymmetry should be described three-dimensionally using three angles: pitch, roll, and yaw. pitch refers to the rotation of the object around the transverse axis, roll refers to the rotation of the object around the anteroposterior axis, and yaw refers to the rotation of the object around the vertical axis. however, there has been a lack of 3d classification of mandibular asymmetry as well as evaluations on transverse dental compensation in patients with asymmetry. the purpose of this study was to evaluate the characteristic transverse dental compensations in patients with facial asymmetry and mandibular prognathism and to compare features of dental compensations between two types of mandibular asymmetry using 3d cbct.","{'answer_start': [1899], 'text': ['the rotation of the object around the anteroposterior axis']}",,anatomy,"{'authors': ['Svetlana Tyan *', 'Hong-Sik Park *', 'Munkhshur Janchivdorj', 'Sun-Ho Han', 'Su-Jung Kim', 'Hyo-Won Ahn'], 'doi': 'https://doi.org/10.2319/030915-142.1', 'meta': 'Angle Orthod (2016) 86 (3): 421–430.', 'title': 'Three-dimensional analysis of molar compensation in patients with facial asymmetry and mandibular prognathism'}",8522b0f6-4931-467b-a499-b1b74918c92b
what is the composition of stainless steel wires?,"with the advent of stainless steels in world war i and the refinement of drawing processes to form wires in the late 1930s, gold archwires gradually lost favor to the smaller cross-sectional areas that stainless steel archwires could provide. by the 1950s the type 300 series of stainless steel alloys were used for most orthodontic materials. these typically contained 17 to 25% chromium and 8 to 25% nickel, with the balance being iron. when at least 10 to 13% chromium was present in the alloy, a coherent oxide layer formed that passivated the surface, thereby rendering the alloy stainless. when at least 8% nickel was present, the single phase structure of austenite was stabilized, and the overall corrosion resistance was enhanced. carbon content was purposely maintained below 0.20% to reduce the formation of chromium carbides (figure 1), structures that can ultimately foster the corrosion of austenitic steels. stainless steels were strong, typically about five times stronger than structural girders, and their stiffnesses were 93 to 100% that of conventional carbon steels. these stainless steels were also sensitive to the products of incomplete combustion, such as those found in a sooty flame, and could not be cooled slowly through the temperature regime of 425 to 815c or else sensitization to corrosion could occur. (to convert c to f, multiply by 1.8 and add 32.) as the came to a close, rocky mountain orthodontics was offering two tempers of cold-worked stainless steels: a standard and an extra hard grade. today, american orthodontics advertises three grades of stainless steel wire: a standard, a gold tone, and a super gold tone. stainless steel, however, was not destined to enjoy the predominance in the marketplace that gold had enjoyed for so many years before.","{'answer_start': [370], 'text': ['17 to 25% chromium and 8 to 25% nickel, with the balance being iron']}",,materials,"{'authors': ['Robert P.

"for growing class ii patients, which functional appliance has been shown to restrict maxillary growth?","the twin block, herbst, and mara patients showed an increase in mandibular length of 1.5 mm per year, 1.2 mm per year, and 0.94 mm per year, respectively. similar trends were noted by baccetti et al, wieslander et al, and berger et al for these appliances. it has been suggested that the most effective timing for treatment with the bionator, twin block, and herbst appliances is during or slightly after the onset of the pubertal peak in growth velocity. the mean age of the patients in this study at the start of functional appliance treatment was 10 years 7 months for the bionator group and 10 years 11 months for the twin block group. the herbst and mara groups began 1 2 years thereafter. this difference in chronologic age could not be explain the larger increments of growth experienced with the twin block, herbst and mara, since all of the patients were matched by their growth maturation status. the greatest change in mandibular length occurred during functional appliance treatment when compared with the controls. after this initial growth surge, only the mara patients sustained a longer mandibular growth length of 1.0 mm per year when compared with the controls. this finding is in agreement with that reported by livieratos and johnston who suggested that functional appliances place a mortgage on mandibular growth. control clinical trials also found no significant alteration of mandibular length long term with the utilization of functional appliances. the maxillary length measurement was significantly larger when comparing the herbst and mara groups to the twin block sample at t1. therefore, it can be appreciated as to how much restriction of maxillary growth occurred during treatment with the herbst appliance when compared with the twin block, mara, and control groups. temporary restriction in maxillary growth by the herbst appliance is well documented in multiple investigations. and may be due to the posterior direction of the force generated by the pistons on the maxilla. in addition, the posterior direction of force caused the maxilla to rotate in a clockwise manner, as demonstrated in this study and by von bremen and pancherz. the herbst group also demonstrated the most upper lip retrusion compared with any group after appliance wear, as previously reported by pancherz and anehus-pancherz.","{'answer_start': [359], 'text': ['herbst appliance']}",,clinical,"{'authors': ['Nicole J.

"in the segmented arch technique, why is a transpalatal arch (tpa) placed when intruding teeth with a continuous arch?","the use of j-hook and high-pull headgear associated with continuous archwires has been advocated for the treatment of deep overbite. although this treatment approach has considerable merit, a number of limitations are associated with the use of this appliance. the amount of force delivered to the maxillary anterior teeth is substantial and may result in significant resorption of the roots of the anterior teeth. the forces delivered by the headgear are also intermittent and the correction of the deep overbite is less efficient than with the use of continuous light forces. considerable patient cooperation is generally required. continuous intrusion arches with the segmented arch technique may be used to obtain genuine intrusion of the anterior teeth. a pure intrusive force is applied to the incisors using a 0.017"" x 0.025"" tma (ormco, glendora, calif) continuous intrusion arch tied to a rigid anterior segment of wire placed into the incisor brackets. this mechanism assures a point contact of force application to the anterior segment of teeth. pure incisor intrusion is obtained and flaring is controlled by tying back the intrusion arch at the molars. the posterior teeth tend to tip back and extrude. a rigid stainless steel palatal arch is usually placed to control molar position. extrusive forces and molar tipback are controlled with rigid buccal wire segments and, perhaps, high-pull headgear. the headgear pull is usually directed above the center of resistance of the molar to encourage the molar roots to move distally, maintaining a good molar axial inclination.","{'answer_start': [1271], 'text': ['to control molar position']}",,biomechanics,"{'authors': ['Bhavna Shroff, DDS, MDentSc', 'Won M.

"regarding the bonding of orthodontic brackets, what happens to the smear layer after etching with phosphoric acid?","scanning electron microscopy (sem) has been the traditional method used to study the overall microscopic surface structure of dental tissues; however, it is not a surface-specific technique. a significant difficulty associated with the use of sem in examining etched enamel is the lack of consensus on grading systems. recent studies using the bet gas adsorption method support the suggestion that enamel porosity, surface area, and pore size are more important toward an understanding of enamel topography than is a defined etch pattern. gas adsorption has been studied theoretically for most of the 21st century, and the simplest of the resulting theories has provided the insight needed for most applications. still, the number of studies on dental enamel that used the gas absorption method is limited. we sought to expand on the knowledge of enamel topography by using this same method in our studies to compare how enamel properties are altered by acid-etching procedures. when phosphoric acid is applied to the dental enamel surface, it dissolves the outer smear layer, which is approximately 5 to 10 microns in thickness. the outer 5 to 50 micron ends of the enamel prisms are selectively dissolved as well. as a result, microscopic pores and enamel crystallites are exposed, resulting in a retentive surface for the primer.1 it is assumed that this increase in the number of pores and in surface irregularities results in a larger exposed area of enamel, which creates a greater area for bonding and higher subsequent bond strengths. eventually, too much acid exposure will cause the enamel crystallites to be gradually dissolved and broken down until the structure of enamel is destroyed. it is assumed that the once-opened enamel pores will slowly become obliterated by collapsing enamel structures. figures 3a and 3b illustrate the changes in surface area and pore volume that were observed after variable etch times. when all three time points are compared, a clear increase in surface area and pore volume was evident after etching. this increased etch time may have contributed to an increased number of exposed pores and, thus, to increased surface area and pore volume through the dissolving action of phosphoric acid. after 60 seconds of etching, however, both surface area and pore volume were much lower than for the other time points. this finding may be due to the aforementioned collapse of structures and the obliteration of some pores, leading to an overall decrease in both surface area and pore volume that can be detected by the bet gas adsorption method.","{'answer_start': [1041], 'text': ['it dissolves the outer smear layer']}",,materials,"{'authors': ['Trang T.

"in growing class ii patients with mandibular retrusion, what are the condylar modifications induced by functional appliances?","the significant supplementary growth of the mandible in the ltg was concurrent with favorable changes in both the anteroposterior position (co-olp) and the growth direction (cl-ml) of the mandibular condyle. this growth modification has been described in the past as posterior mandibular morphogenetic rotation, a biological mechanism leading to greater increments in total mandibular length and, thus, efficiently improving the skeletal sagittal relationships in class-ii malocclusion. in fact, the group treated during the pubertal growth spurt presented with all the cephalometric signs that demonstrate the effectiveness of functional treatment of skeletal class-ii disharmony (1) increases in total mandibular length (co-pg), (2) increases in ramus height (co-go), (3) opening of the gonial angle (ar-goi-me), (4) posterior rotation of the condylar line in relation to the mandibular line (cl-ml), and (5) backward displacement of the condylar head in relation to the reference system (co-olp). although not statistically significant, dentoskeletal modifications during active treatment with the bionator appliance (t1 t2) deserve to be discussed to compare the short-term results of the present study with those reported by other investigators. the craniofacial changes, as evaluated in the t1 t2 interval in the total treated sample, examined in this study (23 subjects) approximate those found by livieratos and johnston in their investigation of short-term effects of bionator therapy as the first phase of comprehensive class-ii correction.","{'answer_start': [681], 'text': ['(1) increases in total mandibular length (co-pg), (2) increases in ramus height (co-go), (3) opening of the gonial angle (ar-goi-me), (4) posterior rotation of the condylar line in relation to the mandibular line (cl-ml), and (5) backward displacement of the condylar head in relation to the reference system (co-olp)']}",,clinical,"{'authors': ['Kurt Faltin, Jr, DDS, PhD', 'Rolf M.

"regarding the properties alloys used in orthodontics, what are the advantages of beta titanium (tma) compared to nitinol?","the last major alloy system to have an impact on current clinical orthodontics was introduced around 1980. stabilized beta-phase titanium alloys contain about 80% titanium. in addition, they include 11.5% molybdenum, 6% zirconium, and 4.5% tin. historically, pure titanium has a stiffness (102 gpa) that is about one-half that of stainless steel; the stiffness subsequently varies from 99 to 127 gpa upon alloying to form the conventional type of alpha-phase titanium alloys. for orthodontic use, one of dr. burstones primary objectives was to produce an alloy whose deactivation characteristics were about one-third that of stainless steel or twice that of a conventional martensitic stabilized nitinol. this led to ormco corporations introduction of the low-stiffness beta-phase titanium-molybdenum alloy known as tma. advantages of this alloy were several. when compared with nitinol, tma was inherently smoother (figure 6), could be welded, and had good formability. moreover, when compared with stainless steels, tma produced gentler linear forces per unit of deactivation and had substantially more range and higher springback. indeed, tma was almost the perfect wire, since its characteristics were so balanced. yet tma, too, had a latent flaw the coefficients of friction were the worst of any of the orthodontic alloys, and consequently its ability to accommodate the sliding of teeth was limited (figure 7). ironically, the first alloy to be used during this modern era of orthodontics, stainless steel, remains the best in this regard.","{'answer_start': [896], 'text': ['inherently smoother (figure 6), could be welded, and had good formability']}",,materials,"{'authors': ['Robert P.

"regarding the segmental lefort i osteotomy, what is the maximum transverse expansion that can be achieved?","the classical technique of closing a skeletal open bite in a patient with a long face involves a lefort i osteotomy, impaction of the maxillary posterior dentition to allow mandibular autorotation, an increased steepness of the maxillary occlusal plane, and then performing a mandibular ramus procedure to accommodate the occlusal plane change as well as the anterior-posterior change. the mandibular procedure may be a sagittal split ramus osteotomy if any advancement is required, or it may be an ivro if there is to be either a mandibular setback or accommodation for any change in occlusal plane. orthognathic surgery for correction of open bite malocclusion in this manner appears to have achieved much greater stability and esthetics than orthodontic anterior dental extrusion. in the hierarchy of surgical stability, maxillary impaction is among the most stable of all orthognathic surgical procedures. one possible variation to the proposed treatment plan would have been a segmental lefort i osteotomy to differentially affect the posterior dentition and anterior dentition, widen the maxillary transverse dimension, and perform a mandibular sagittal split osteotomy with advancement genioplasty to correct the mandibular deficiency. the advantage to widening with the segmental lefort would be a single-stage rather than a two-stage surgery. patients requiring two-stage surgery will occasionally undergo the first procedure only to decline any subsequent surgical procedures that will produce the necessary vertical and anterior-posterior changes. typically, the maximum amount of transverse expansion that is practical with a segmental lefort is 5 7 mm. after closely examining the transverse dimension of this patient with an occlusogram, the magnitude of the maxillary transverse deficiency was determined to be too great to obtain both the transverse and vertical correction at the same time with a segmental lefort (figure 9). the occlusogram allows all the intended orthodontic movements in the anterior-posterior and transverse dimensions to be performed on an acetate tracing before treatment begins.","{'answer_start': [1658], 'text': ['5 7 mm']}",,clinical,"{'authors': ['R.

"regarding growth timing relative to cervical stage (cs), when is the mandibular pubertal spurt most commonly observed?","the results of the present study showed that the pubertal peak in mandibular length occurred after cs 3 in 78% of the cases. this meant that, in more than 3/4 of the subjects, the mandibular pubertal growth spurt could be expected in the year after cs 3. as a peculiar feature of this study, chronological age was entered in the predictive model as a curvilinear variable (polynomial curve up to the third order or degree). this feature was a very important aspect when analyzing the peak in mandibular growth as a function of age. as a matter of fact, if age was entered as a linear variable, the probability of having the mandibular growth peak would increase or decrease linearly along with age. however, mandibular growth was not linear along with age but rather followed a curvilinear (nonlinear) trend that was characterized, particularly during adolescence, by an acceleration that reached a peak that was followed by a deceleration until the end of active growth. the results of the present study were not comparable with those by engel et al. and gray et al., who applied a linear mixed model analysis to identify mandibular length. in the present study, a logistic regression model to detect the presence or absence of the mandibular growth peak was applied. the regression equations found by engel et al. and gray et al, therefore, allowed calculation of either mandibular length or the change in mandibular length, which has limited clinical value. the regression equation that was found in the present study allows calculating the probability of having the mandibular pubertal growth peak in the subsequent year, which can be useful clinically. in addition, these previous investigations were characterized by relatively small sample sizes (2915 and 2516 subjects). the most appropriate statistical approach that appears to answer this question is a multilevel logistic regression model in which the outcome variable is the presence or absence of the pubertal growth spurt (measured as the greatest annual increase in the length co-gn), and the predictive variables were presence or absence of cs 3, sex, chronological age at each film, and interactions among these variables. only the studies of morris et al. and montasser applied this statistical approach. the cvm method that was used by morris et al., however, was the version based on the evaluation method of the older five vertebrae. montasser used the cvm method proposed by hassel and farman. in addition, these studies used chronological age only as a linear predictive variable without considering that, after a given age, the probability of finding the pubertal peak should decrease. the present study, therefore, was the first to apply a multilevel logistic model to investigate the role of chronological age (up to third order), sex, and cvm method on three cervical vertebrae for the prediction of the pubertal peak in mandibular growth. the limitations of the present study were the lack of validation of the prediction model and the fact that the same examiner evaluated both the increments in co-gn and the cvm stages.","{'answer_start': [176], 'text': ['the mandibular pubertal growth spurt could be expected in the year after cs 3']}",,growth,"{'authors': ['Lorenzo Franchi a', 'Michele Nieri b', 'Irene Lomonaco c', 'James A.

"regarding cobalt-chromium wires, what is the effect of heat treatment at 900f for 3 minutes on the ductility of the wire?","low temperature heat treatment of orthodontic wire to increase spring performance and force delivery has been repeatedly discussed in the dental literature. it is generally accepted that the process improves the elastic qualities of stainless steel archwires by relieving the stresses retained from archwire formation. certain cobalt-chromium alloys, in addition, can be strengthened by heat treatment. the present study evaluates the effects of heat treatment upon cobalt-chromium alloy orthodontic wire. a particular cobalt-chromium alloy known as elgiloy has found wide application in orthodontics. this material was developed by the elgin watch company for use in watch mainsprings. cobalt-chromium wire is similar in appearance to stainless steel and is actually a cobalt-base alloy containing chromium, nickel, and with smaller amounts of molybdenum, manganese, beryllium and carbon. the advantages claimed for cobalt-chromium wire over stainless steel are: superior physical properties, greater resistance to fatigue and distortion, and longer function as a resilient spring. also, it can be electrolytically polished, easily soldered, and easily heat-treated to remove internal stresses and increase spring performance. certain problems affecting the orthodontic use of cobalt-chromium wire include the tendency to harden at the point where two segments are joined by soldering or spot welding and the greater degree of work hardening for the same amount of wire manipulation compared with other materials. therefore, cobalt-chromium wire is supplied in four tempers to provide flexibility with the differing tempers reacting differently to heat treatment. in comparing the physical properties of cobalt-chromium alloy with watch-spring steel, the manufacturer claims that cobalt-chromium alloy is superior by 275 percent in resistance to set, 100 percent in fatigue resistance, and has a higher resistance to corrosion and a slightly higher yield strength, ultimate strength, and hardness. denver conducted an investigation of cobalt-chromium wire to determine the effects of heat treatment at 900f for 3 minutes on wire ductility and the ability of a vertical loop to withstand permanent deformation. he reported a 70 percent reduction in ductility and a 60 percent improvement in the ability of cobalt-chromium wire to resist permanent deformation following heat treatment.","{'answer_start': [2223], 'text': ['a 70 percent reduction in ductility']}",,materials,"{'authors': ['GALEN M.

"in lateral head film cephalometric analysis, what are possible sources of measurement errors?","for effective analysis of facial asymmetry, the horizontal and vertical reference lines have to be established on the film. grummons et al reported that a midsagittal reference line (msr) was constructed from crista galli through the anterior nasal spine to the chin area. if anatomical variations in the upper and middle facial regions exist, an alternative way of constructing the msr line is to draw a line from the midpoint of z-plane through either ans or through the midpoint of both foramina rotundum (fr-fr line). in the present study, we used 0.016-inch stainless steel wires on the outer surface of the film cassette in order to establish the horizontal and vertical reference lines on the posteroanterior cephalometric radiographs. to expose the same horizontal and vertical reference lines on all of the developed films, we used the same cassette with lines for each exposure, and exposed posteroanterior cephalometric radiographs after the x-ray films were always at the same place within the cassette. then we established geometric horizontal and vertical reference lines parallel with the reference lines of our reliable landmark. because each landmark is located at a different anteroposterior distance from the rotational axis, and the moving pattern on the film increases as the distance from the rotational axis increases, the relationship of each landmark between the reference position and rotational angles can change. in other words, the correlation among the landmarks on the film according to magnification changes since the distance from the rotational axis of the head to each landmark varies. theoretically, it would be effective using the midline landmark that is located at the same anteroposterior distance on vertical rotational axis in order to solve these limitations. however, this may not be clinically possible. the preciseness of the measurements in head films may be influenced by various errors such as the projection error, the landmark identification error, and the measuring technique error. these errors lead to a wrong diagnosis in orthodontics and also, the real magnitude of such projection errors may not be considered in a study using a measuring technique. therefore, it is necessary to analyze these errors. in the present study, the potential projection errors of posteroanterior cephalometric radiographs were identified by analyzing the vertical and horizontal distances of 17 landmarks including bilateral landmarks due to head rotation in the vertical z-axis.","{'answer_start': [1943], 'text': ['the projection error, the landmark identification error, and the measuring technique']}",,clinical,"{'authors': ['Young-Jooh Yoon, DDS, MSD, PhD', 'Dong-Hoon Kim, DDS, MSD, PhD', 'Pil-Sik Yu, DDS, MSD', 'Heung-Joong Kim, DDS, MSD, PhD', 'Eui-Hwan Choi, DDS, MSD, PhD', 'Kwang-Won Kim, DDS, MSD, PhD'], 'doi': 'https://doi.org/10.1043/0003-3219(2002)072<0036:EOHROP>2.0.CO;2', 'meta': 'Angle Orthod (2002) 72 (1): 36–42.', 'title': 'Effect of Head Rotation on Posteroanterior Cephalometric Radiographs'}",4cf97d79-1bb5-4d1c-a01e-574c7674978d
"regarding the development of the craniofacial structures, what is the process of formation of the cranial base?","the fgf and msx genes are important for craniofacial development, particularly for the calvaria, as highlighted by the etiologic relationship between mutations of these genes and human craniosynostosis. however, the role of the fgf and msx genes in the ventral part of the cranium, the cranial base, are largely unknown, and this structure is important for coordinated development and growth of craniofacial skeletons.the cranial base, or basicranium, plays a key role in integrated craniofacial development. it is different from the facial bones that are formed through intramembranous ossification. the cranial base is formed through endochondral ossification and, in this process, a cartilage template is formed first and eventually replaced by bone via chondrocyte apoptosis and osteogenic cell migration. well-organized cartilaginous structures analogous to long-bone growth plates, termed synchondroses, are formed among cranial base bones, acting as growth centers in advancing growth. cranial base synchondroses ossify at different growth stages in human beings, and are regulated by a mechanism that, thus far, is not completely understood. the cranial base is a unique structure that differs from other endochondral bones. skeletogenic cells of the cranial base are derived from paraxial somites in the posterior part and from the neural crest in the anterior part. these two different embryologic parts are distinguishable by distinct growth features. the posterior cranial base matures and reaches its final size earlier than the anterior cranial base. however, the anterior cranial base has a more active and more prolonged growth process that lasts to a very late growth stage. this feature is a prerequisite for coordinated craniofacial development and growth. the basicranium also differs from other portions of the endochondral skeleton; to a great extent, the development and growth of the basicranium are under the influence of the brain, and the final shape and size of the basicranium follow that of the brain. cranial base angulation is formed by the relative flexion of its anterior and posterior parts, and is a unique feature of human beings and a reflection of brain evolution.","{'answer_start': [636], 'text': ['endochondral ossification and, in this process, a cartilage template is formed first and eventually replaced by bone via chondrocyte apoptosis and osteogenic cell migration']}",,growth,"{'authors': ['Xuguang Nie'], 'doi': 'https://doi.org/10.2319/082305-298', 'meta': 'Angle Orthod (2006) 76 (6): 990–995.', 'title': 'Developmentally Regulated Expression of Msx1, Msx2 and Fgfs in the Developing Mouse Cranial Base'}",766e4fbd-cafa-4ba6-818c-4d7a9553db56
"regarding biomechanics of orthodontic tooth movement, what forces are required to achieve pure rotation?","pure rotation or tipping occurs when the center of rotation and center of resistance are at the same point. pure translation occurs when the center of rotation is at infinity. pure rotation requires a couple or two opposite and equal forces. pure translation requires a single force acting through the center of resistance or a single force not through the center of resistance but with a properly balanced couple. a single force not acting through the center of resistance and without a couple creates translation and rotation. the center of resistance translates but, in addition, the body will rotate about the center of resistance. there also occurs an instantaneous center of rotation for the system somewhere between infinity and the center of resistance. this center of rotation is related to the perpendicular distance between the force vector and the center resistance. the framework of the attachment mechanism can be adjusted by extension arms so that when the force is applied, it, in effect, will be traveling through the center of resistance or at any distance from it that is desired. the facebow is a good example of this method. while the framework of the facebow may take on many designs and points of attachment to the tooth, the effect on the dental unit is ultimately only related to the shortest perpendicular distance between the force vector and the center of resistance. 1 1 fundamental physics teaches that the shortest perpendicular distance between a force vector and the center of resistance of a body determines the center of rotation. figure 5 illustrates these principles as they apply to headgear systems. regardless of the design of the facebow or j hook, the body (tooth) reacts to the force system of the headgear that is computed by figuring the shortest perpendicular distance from the force vector to the center of resistance. this distance dictates how the tooth moves and, more specifically, where the instantaneous center of rotation will be (fig. 6).","{'answer_start': [199], 'text': ['a couple or two opposite and equal forces']}",,biomechanics,"{'authors': ['FRANK W.

"in orthodontics, how is anchorage defined?","anchorage is defined as the resistance to unwanted orthodontic tooth movement. it is one of the most important aspects in producing esthetic, functional, and stable occlusal results. therefore, anchorage control and selecting appropriate mechanics should be determined at the treatment planning stage. several intra- and extraoral adjuncts enhance anchorage control including the transpalatal, nance, and lingual arches; headgear; or temporary anchorage devices (tads). anchorage loss is an unfortunate consequence of leveling and aligning, overjet reduction or space closure and is usually greater in the maxillary than mandibular arch. this complicates treatment, and when anchorage preparation is not adequately planned, molar distalization may be required during treatment. certain initial patient characteristics and treatment-related factors have been reported to influence loss of anchorage. these include growth, age, sex, malocclusion type, pretreatment upper molar angulation, crowding, and overjet. treatment-related factors, such as extractions versus non-extraction, site of extraction, high frictional resistance appliances, type of tooth movement (bodily movement or torque), the use of intraoral or extra-oral anchorage devices and the use of heavy and uncontrolled forces can also play a role in increasing anchorage loss. anchorage loss has been investigated with different orthodontic fixed appliance systems. in their retrospective study, geron et al. found that anchorage loss was significantly greater with labial edgewise appliances compared with lingual edgewise appliances. although various studies have concluded that no significant differences exist between conventional and self-ligating bracket systems for anchorage loss, rajesh et al. found that anchorage loss was significantly greater with roth than mbt appliances. no study to date has investigated the difference in anchorage loss between 0.018-inch and 0.022-inch bracket slot systems, which may vary due to the differences in play (friction between the bracket slot and archwire) and critical contact angle (angle of contact between archwire and bracket slot wall). therefore, this study aimed to determine if slot size had an effect on anchorage loss of the maxillary first molar. the null hypothesis was that there is no statistically significant difference between the 0.018-inch and 0.022-inch slot bracket systems in terms of maxillary first molar anchorage loss on completion of orthodontic treatment.","{'answer_start': [24], 'text': ['the resistance to unwanted orthodontic tooth movement']}",,biomechanics,"{'authors': ['Yassir A.

what are the possible etiologies of buccal crossbites?,"dental crossbites may involve only a few teeth but may also involve segments of teeth or the entire dentition. a dental crossbite often exhibits aberrant buccal-lingual inclinations of one or more teeth. with skeletal crossbites, the transverse dimension of the maxillary basal bone is smaller than the mandibular basal bone. such transverse deficiencies can be corrected with rapid maxillary expansion (in adolescents), surgically assisted rme (called transverse maxillary do more recently), or a segmental lefort i osteotomy. if mandibular symphyseal distraction is being considered, the anticipated maxillary transverse expansion must be predicted before determining the appropriate amount of increase in the mandibular arch width. in some patients, the appropriate amount of buccal overjet is present, but both the maxillary and mandibular arches are narrow and need to be expanded (figure 1a). patients will often comment i don't like these dark spaces between my teeth and cheeks, or i want a full, broad smile or i want a hollywood smile. treatment decisions should not be predicated strictly on esthetics but should also address function, stability, and balance. but if a full, broad, functional, and stable smile can be obtained, each clinician should strive to achieve the patient's stated goals. with maxillary transverse expansion previously limited by the mandibular arch width, patients were not always able to obtain their desired results. now with the ability to expand both arches using do, a full, functional, and stable occlusion can be achieved. occasionally, patients will present to the office with a complete buccal crossbite where the maxillary dentition telescopes over the mandibular dentition (figure 1b). the possible etiologies could be related to a habit, an excessively large maxilla, or a skeletal mandibular transverse deficiency associated with hypoglossia hypodactylia syndrome. previously, the only method of correction was a vertical symphyseal osteotomy, rotating the two hemi-mandibles laterally, placing a bone graft, and fixating. do has the benefit of tremendous adjustability and does not require a bone graft. in addition, the regenerate bone, once calcified, has the same properties as the innate mandibular bone. as a result, there are no questions regarding the success and viability of a graft material.","{'answer_start': [1777], 'text': ['a habit, an excessively large maxilla, or a skeletal mandibular transverse deficiency associated with hypoglossia hypodactylia syndrome']}",,clinical,"{'authors': ['Richard Conley, DMD', 'Harry Legan, DDS'], 'doi': 'https://doi.org/10.1043/0003-3219(2003)073<0003:MSDODA>2.0.CO;2', 'meta': 'Angle Orthod (2003) 73 (1): 3–11.', 'title': 'Mandibular Symphyseal Distraction Osteogenesis: Diagnosis and Treatment Planning Considerations'}",24de3b96-2bcf-46cb-8b88-5e49b66e29fa
"in orthodontics, how is interproximal enamel reduction (ipr) performed?","the grinding of interproximal tooth surfaces was first described by ballard in 1944 as a method to correct a lack of harmony in tooth size. interdental stripping, also known as interproximal enamel reduction (ipr), is a common clinical procedure in orthodontics used to gain space, correct bolton tooth-size discrepancies, rectify morphologic anomalies, and reduce interdental gingival papillary retraction. currently, ipr is performed by using handheld or motor-driven abrasive strips, handpiece-mounted, diamond-coated disks, and tungsten-carbide or diamond burs. many studies have investigated the effects of various interdental stripping methods on the enamel surface. it has been reported that ipr creates enamel furrows and scratches that might promote greater plaque retention and increase risk of caries. for this reason, several treatment protocols have been proposed to achieve a smooth surface. nowadays, various mechanical or automatic rotating devices can produce enamel surfaces that are even smoother than natural enamel in a reasonable time and with a good acceptance by the patient. danesh et al. reported that after polishing, surfaces that had been treated with an automatic oscillating system presented with better results in terms of smoothness. recently, various methods have been gradually improved with the primary goal of obtaining precise ipr in terms of optimal amount of enamel grinding. many authors recommend a reduction of no more than half the enamel coating's original thickness to avoid immoderate degradation. it has been claimed that 0.3 0.4 mm of enamel can be safely removed, making ipr a minimally invasive procedure. several investigators have reported that mechanical stripping can reduce chairside time, achieving more and better interproximal reduction than manual techniques. johner et al. demonstrated that, when testing three different mechanical stripping methods, the average amount of stripping was generally smaller than the intended amount of enamel reduction. although many studies have analyzed enamel surfaces after stripping, no data exist on the quantitative and qualitative evaluation of abrasive strips before and after use. in fact, the amount of enamel reduction depends on several factors, such as exerted pressure and enamel hardness, but mostly on particle size of the abrasive and the time used to apply it. therefore, the aim of the present study was to test in vitro and in vivo the wear performance of flexible, oscillating diamond-coated strips compared with unused strips by means of the tribological test and scanning electronic microscope (sem).","{'answer_start': [439], 'text': ['using handheld or motor-driven abrasive strips, handpiece-mounted, diamond-coated disks, and tungsten-carbide or diamond burs']}",,clinical,"{'authors': ['Roberta Lione', 'Francesca Gazzani', 'Chiara Pavoni', 'Stefano Guarino', 'Vincenzo Tagliaferri', 'Paola Cozza'], 'doi': 'https://doi.org/10.2319/071516-552.1', 'meta': 'Angle Orthod (2017) 87 (3): 455–459.', 'title': 'In vitro and in vivo evaluation of diamond-coated strips'}",52cf2453-4c31-4f58-b9e0-c3b61614a63e
"in patients with unilateral functional crossbite (fupxb), which problems have been associated with this malocclusion?","posterior crossbite is a common malocclusion with a prevalence of 7.7%1 to 17%.2 some studies have shown that functional unilateral posterior crossbite (fupxb) has been associated statistically with asymmetrical function of the masticatory muscles, signs and symptoms of temporomandibular disorders (tmd), such as pain, headache, and muscle tenderness, which may relate to activity of masticatory muscle performance. previous investigators have demonstrated that there is an individual chewing pattern for mandibular movements in adults. throckmorton et al described chewing as an event determined at two levels, an individual central chewing pattern generator and peripheral events inducing chewing adaptations. the individual central chewing pattern starts to be established with tooth eruption and is well established in a child with a complete deciduous dentition. the central pattern generator appears to establish the chewing cycle shape by controlling the sequence of muscle contractions in the opening and closing movements of mandible. once the central chewing cycle pattern has been established, it appears to be relatively resistant to change. occlusal interferences occurring during bone development may lead to mandibular displacement and can induce a compensatory asymmetric mandibular growth. in early life, there is a much greater potential for adaptive changes to determine the central pattern of chewing. corrections made in adults do not show consistent changes in the overall mastication cycle shape impairing the total effectiveness of an occlusal correction. therefore, several studies suggest that fupxb should be corrected as early as possible to promote bilateral condylar symmetry and enhance normal growth and development.","{'answer_start': [199], 'text': ['asymmetrical function of the masticatory muscles, signs and symptoms of temporomandibular disorders (tmd), such as pain, headache, and muscle tenderness']}",,pathology,"{'authors': ['Marco Antonio Canada Salioni', 'Silmara Elena Papa Pellizoni', 'Antonio Sérgio Guimarães', 'Yara Juliano', 'Luís Garcia Alonso'], 'doi': 'https://doi.org/10.1043/0003-3219(2005)75[362:FUPCEO]2.0.CO;2', 'meta': 'Angle Orthod (2005) 75 (3): 362–367.', 'title': 'Functional Unilateral Posterior Crossbite Effects on Mastication Movements Using Axiography'}",54792103-0c69-4a22-9462-59712b05ca60
"during orthodontic treatment, what causes failure of ceramic bracket wings?","ceramic brackets, which are primarily of monocrystalline or polycrystalline sapphire, are esthetically more pleasing than their metal, coated metal and plastic predecessors. they also appear to have some superior bonding characteristics. however, there are some indications of reduced fracture toughness which may lead to uncontrolled bracket wing failure during function. while ceramic bracket bonding has been addressed to some extent, the relationship between bracket bonding behavior and different bonding systems still requires clarification. brackets are fabricated of stainless steel, plastic, and in recent years, ceramic. a wide variety of bracket types is available for clinical use. ongoing research and development continues to improve their properties. the shortcomings of plastic brackets in their present forms include moisture absorption, which progressively weakens the bond strength, discoloration and excessive distortion. while stainless steel attachments have none of the disadvantages of plastic attachments, they are less acceptable esthetically. ceramic brackets made of monocrystalline sapphire are more esthetically pleasing than either plastic or metal brackets. the material is more transparent than plastic and the color is more stable. ceramic brackets are also quite strong; they are more difficult to deform than plastic brackets and have a higher tensile strength than stainless steel. the bonding strength of ceramic brackets has been shown to be significantly higher than that of metal brackets. in fact, orthodontists sometimes experience problems during debonding when the bond is too strong to break. this high bond strength results from silanization of the bracket base, mechanical retention, or both. since these factors may act in combination to produce excessive bond strength, some consideration is being given to fabricating ceramic brackets that are retained only by micromechanical means. fractures occasionally occur at the bracket wings during orthodontic treatment and debonding; removal of these brackets may require use of a high-speed diamond bur a time-consuming procedure. bond failure may also occur at the resin-enamel interface, jeopardizing the integrity of the enamel surface of the bonded tooth. bond strength has been measured in a number of studies using a wide range of etching agents, and adhesives with metal and plastic brackets. todate, investigations regarding the shear bond strength of ceramic brackets have been limited, with the majority of the data reporting chemically-cured adhesive systems. the purpose of this investigation was to determine the shear and tensile bond strength of various ceramic and ceramic-filled brackets in combination with a variety of commonly used bonding systems.","{'answer_start': [277], 'text': ['reduced fracture toughness']}",,materials,"{'authors': ['Spiro J.

"regarding the analysis of mixed dentition, what are the methods for predicting the size of the unerupted permanent teeth?","mixed dentition analysis is an important aspect of orthodontic diagnosis and treatment planning. it is a valuable tool in determining whether the treatment plan may involve serial extraction, guidance of eruption, space maintenance, space regaining, or just periodic observation of the patient. three basic approaches for prediction of the size of the unerupted permanent teeth during the mixed dentition have been used. measurement of the size of the unerupted teeth on radiographs, as recommended by staley et al and de paula et al; estimation from proportionality tables, as reported by moyers and tanaka and johnston; and a combination of the radiographic and prediction table method, as recommended by hixon and oldfather and bishara et al. mixed dentition analysis using moyers tables and tanaka and johnston have several advantages. no radiographs are required, tables can be used for both the maxillary and mandibular arch estimations, and there is a fairly good accuracy despite a tendency to overestimate the size of unerupted teeth. the development of these two methods, however, was based on data derived from a population of northern european descent. therefore, the accuracy of these prediction methods may be in question when applied to a population of different ethnic origin. a review of the literature revealed that mixed dentition analyses were varied between different racial and population groups: ferguson et al and frankel and benz for black americans; schirmer and wiltshire for black africans; lee-chan et al for asian-americans; bishara et al for population samples from egypt, mexico, and the usa; flores-mir et al for peruvians; al-khadra for saudi arabians; nourallah et al for syrians; yuen et al for hong kong chinese; jaroontham and godfrey for thai population; legovic et al for croatians; otuyemi and noar for nigerian; and diagne et al for senegalese population. populations of different racial origins generally had average values that were significantly different from those reported for whites, but in most cases the clinical significance was questionable. several recent studies investigating mixed dentition analyses in different populations derived their samples from subjects attending orthodontic clinics; this may have introduced a source of bias because they may not be representative of the total population. in addition, there was a wide variation in the sample sizes within these studies ranging from 34 to 600 subjects. there have also been questions about applying these methods, which are based on pooled male and female data, rather than considering the sexes separately. in addition, there is some evidence of secular trends of changing dimension of teeth, which may require progressive modification of mixed dentition analysis for different populations. there are few published data on mixed dentition analysis for arabic populations. the purposes of this study were to: (1) examine the applicability of the tanaka and johnston method of prediction in a jordanian population; and (2) develop a new prediction method for this specific population if it proved to be necessary.","{'answer_start': [421], 'text': ['measurement of the size of the unerupted teeth on radiographs, as recommended by staley et al and de paula et al; estimation from proportionality tables, as reported by moyers and tanaka and johnston; and a combination of the radiographic and prediction table method, as recommended by hixon and oldfather and bishara et al']}",,growth,"{'authors': ['Zaid Bakri Al-Bitar', 'Iyad Khaled Al-Omari', 'Hawazen Nezar Sonbol', 'Hazem Tayseer Al-Ahmad', 'Ahmad Mohammad Hamdan'], 'doi': 'https://doi.org/10.2319/0003-3219(2008)078[0670:MDAIAJ]2.0.CO;2', 'meta': 'Angle Orthod (2008) 78 (4): 670–675.', 'title': 'Mixed Dentition Analysis in a Jordanian Population'}",f932203f-87da-4c54-9b8b-bc0e30d87ed0
"in mixed dentition, in which direction do permanent incisors drift?","eruption. since early loss can accelerate or delay eruption of the succedaneous tooth, this can affect eruption, sequence and timing. it will alter position of the permanent tooth but only in a special circumstance: following very early loss of a second primary molar, the permanent first molar may erupt mesially. otherwise, space loss associated with drift is primarily a posteruption phenomenon. drift. early loss leads to vertical drift of the opposing primary tooth and to mesiodistal drift of the permanent molars and incisors; it rarely leads to buccolingual drift of permanent or primary teeth. mesial drift of the permanent molars is a well-recognized phenomenon. it is not well-recognized that (a) mesial or distal drift of primary teeth rarely occurs. if a first primary molar is lost prematurely space loss is unlikely (though possible). when space loss does occur in this circumstance, distal movement of the anterior segment is as likely as mesial movement of the posterior segment. an intact primary second molar or canine, in other words, is in itself a good space maintainer; (b) distal drift of permanent incisors is as much to be expected as mesial drift of molars. early loss of primary canines almost invariably leads to space loss by distal movement of the permanent incisors, not by mesial movement of the primary and permanent molars. equilibrium. only minor equilibrium effects are associated with early loss. forces generated in the periodontal lignament are not affected, but resting tongue and lip pressure may be. the tongue will tend to partially occupy a space in the dental arch and lip posture may be affected by early loss of primary incisors. an altered chewing pattern, to avoid the side where a tooth is missing, may result. there is little or no evidence, however, that these possible changes will influence tooth position significantly.","{'answer_start': [483], 'text': ['distal']}",,clinical,"{'authors': ['JAMES L.

"during the initial leveling and alignement treatment phase, which characteristics are needed in initial wires?","having summarized the state of the art of archwires over the last 50 years, lets explore how they complement and supplement one another in everyday practice by applying the concepts of elastic property ratios. in this regard, some reference to the strength, stiffness, and range would be appropriate as a function of the different stages of treatment (figure 8). during the initial stage of treatment, where initial leveling and alignment are desired, great range and light forces are sought. by referencing elastic property ratios of strength, stiffness, and range, two principal types of wires are suggested: either a multistranded stainless steel wire or a nitinol-type wire. the former capitalizes on conventional variable cross-section orthodontics, which was tabulated many years ago in an orthodontic textbook by dr. raymond thurow. the latter makes use of variable modulus orthodontics in which three of the four principal alloys in use today have different stiffnesses for the same shape and size of archwire. as treatment progresses into the intermediate stage, beta-titanium alloys become advantageous as their formability, springback, range, and modest forces per unit deactivation become favorable. larger sizes of nitinol can still be useful here, however, if an 0.022 inch slot is employed. if sliding mechanics are required, undersized stainless steel wires may be used. as the orthodontic patient progresses to the final stage of treatment wherein more arch, stability and small tooth movements are required, wires having substantial stiffnesses but limited ranges are acceptable. consequently, large gauges of beta-titanium or stainless steel wires may be used to maintain arch form while making small rotational, translational, or tipping motions. exactly which alloy is used here depends on the details of the case that is, whether it is more important to have more range, as afforded by a beta-titanium wire, or more stiffness, as afforded by a stainless steel wire.","{'answer_start': [452], 'text': ['great range and light forces']}",,materials,"{'authors': ['Robert P.

"regarding the biomechanics of a base archwire, what should be done in order to have genuine intrusion of the anterior teeth and minimize extrusion of posterior teeth?","among other effects, the action of the base archwire is to extrude posterior teeth as well as to intrude the anteriors. the amount of relative extrusion or intrusion can be influenced by a number of factors. the lower the force delivered from the base archwire, the greater will be the anterior intrusion in comparison with posterior extrusion. furthermore, if genuine intrusion of the incisors is indicated, it is far better to limit the number of teeth in the anterior segment. for example, attempts to intrude all six anterior teeth as a unit are not as effective as the intrusion of two or four incisors alone. lastly, the vertical anchorage of the posterior teeth can be enhanced with the use of an occipital gear. activation of the base archwire produces moments that tend to steepen the plane of occlusion in the maxillary arch and to flatten it in the mandibular arch. since the steepening of the plane of occlusion of the maxillary arch is particularly undesirable in many cases, it is necessary to negate the moment produced from the base wire. this negation can be produced either by the use of a cervical gear with the outer bow high or an occipital gear with the force placed anterior to the center of resistance of the posterior segment.","{'answer_start': [429], 'text': ['limit the number of teeth in the anterior segment']}",,biomechanics,"{'authors': ['Charles J.

"with the exception of material, hardness, state of heat treatment, size, and cross-sectional shape, which other factors affect wire stiffness?","in order to optimize the biological environment for tooth movement and minimize patient discomfort, treatment of tooth disrepancies in the initial malocclusion requires wires of low stiffness to produce gentle forces as he teeth are leveled and aligned. biomechanial considerations require that archwire stiffness be an important criterion, upon which rests the rlationship between orthodontic force and deflection within the elastic working range. burstone stated that the major reason the orthodontist should select a particular wire size is its stiffness or load-deflection rate. stiffness is directly related to cross-sectional size and shape. however, with the introduction of titanium-based alloys and multistrand wires, stiffness can reduced without reducing cross-sectional size or shape. obrien defined stiffness as the slope of the straight line in a bending plot or the amount of force required per unit of activation. some factors that affect wire stiffness include wire material, hardness, state of heat treatment, size, and cross-sectional shape. wire stiffness is also affected by bracket width, interbracket distance, length of wire, and the incorporation of loops. studies of nickel-titanium alloy wires have demonstrated a linear loading and unloading characteristic for some single-phase nickel-titanium alloys. however, newer alloys have been shown to demonstrate nonlinear loading and unloading behaviors with relatively constant force levels throughout their midregions of deactivation. hence, it is impossible to obtain a single value for stiffness or slope of the bending plot for these nonlinear wires. quantifying the magnitude of orthodontic forces at varying deflections is not only necessary for these newer titanium alloys but for the recently introduced multistrand nickel-titanium wires as well.","{'answer_start': [1096], 'text': ['bracket width, interbracket distance, length of wire, and the incorporation of loops']}",,materials,"{'authors': ['Jay M.

"regarding the bonding of orthodontic brackets to ceramic (porcelain), what is required in terms of surface preparation?","when bonding orthodontic brackets to porcelain surfaces, it is necessary to change the inert characteristics of the surface to achieve clinically acceptable bond strength. this alteration is accomplished by either increasing the roughness of the porcelain surface mechanically eg, by either microetching or the use of strong etchants such as hydrofluoric acid (or both), together with a silane coupling agent. such procedures cause irreversible alteration to the glazed porcelain surface. andreasen and stieg found that fracture of the porcelain itself was experienced during both tensile and shear testing when the silane coupling agents were used to increase the bond strength of orthodontic adhesives. the majority of these fractures were found in the shear sample group. newman also reported that the strength of the bond between the resin and porcelain, attained with the use of a silane coupler, was sufficient to cause the fracture of porcelain. such an occurrence is undesirable when associated with the removal of orthodontic brackets from porcelain crowns on restored teeth. therefore, newman suggested that when debonding orthodontic brackets from a porcelain surface, a ligature cutter be applied on the mesial and distal aspects of the bracket base and then twisted gently. another approach used for bracket removal is by squeezing the mesial and distal bracket tie wings together, thus distorting the bracket. the residual composite can then be removed with a scaler or a slow speed finishing bur or both. the present findings indicated that the weakest shear bond strengths were obtained when using phosphoric acid etch alone with the composite adhesive. much stronger and consistent shear bond strength was obtained when the porcelain surface was microetched followed by the use of porc-etch and porcelain conditioner, containing hydrofluoric acid and a silane coupling agent, before bonding the brackets. the new clearfil repair self-etch primer/silane/adhesive combination had comparable mean shear bond strength (table 1). on the other hand, the frequency distribution indicated a slightly higher frequency of shear bond strength values of <4.0 mpa with clearfil repair when compared with porc-etch and porcelain conditioner, ie, having a slightly less consistent behavior (table 2).","{'answer_start': [214], 'text': ['increasing the roughness of the porcelain surface mechanically']}",,materials,"{'authors': ['Raed Ajlouni', 'Samir E.

at what age do the first molars emerge?,"the primary treatment procedure for an impacted tooth is orthodontic traction after surgical exposure of the tooth crown. there are several approaches for the treatment of impacted molars. orthodontic appliances may be available without surgery for partially impacted teeth. a combination of surgical and orthodontic treatment will be selected for severe impactions. although surgical transplanting may be another selection, surgical transplanting or repositioning of teeth generally has a high risk of complications, such as pulp necrosis, ankylosis, and root resorption. if the molars are deeply impacted in the mandible, similar to this patient, inferior alveolar nerve damage by surgery is also possible. based on these considerations, we selected orthodontic extrusion assisted by surgical access to the impacted teeth using a lingual arch for the lower dentition. the lower primary second molars were used effectively as anchors for extrusion of the impacted first molars. however, if the lower primary second molars are not available, implant-anchors are available alternatively as an effective anchorage. there are actually some failures of traction due to ankylosis and external root resorption. furthermore, even the successful cases probably end with an irregular root formation and/or an unesthetic gingival margin of the tooth after orthodontic treatment. in daily clinical practice, the following factors are used to determine whether an impacted tooth can be successfully aligned in proper position: the position and direction of the impacted tooth, the amount of root formation, and the degree of root dilacerations. furthermore, an impacted tooth is likely to have a dilacerated root, which becomes worse with time. for the management of developing dentition, the ability and trained skill to predict tooth eruption accurately is of great importance. this ability will make it possible to answer such questions as to whether a treatment should be conducted for helping proper eruption of the teeth and when a particular therapy should be instituted for the best treatment outcomes. by nolla's mean stage of tooth development, the maxillary and mandibular first molars emerge in the mouth at 6 or 7 years of age when two-thirds of their roots are complete; their roots are completed at 12 to 13 years of age. therefore, the tooth, if impacted, is likely to have a dilacerated root which becomes more severe with a lapse of time. thus, earlier treatment of impacted teeth is recommended. in the present patient, at 9 to 10 years of age, the traction of lower and upper first molars was initiated, and the traction succeeded at age 12 years 9 months, which just matched the time of the root completion. as the result, the first molars showed no pathological findings in their root development. if the spontaneous eruption of the impacted tooth was not expected, the early treatment including impacted tooth traction was highly anticipated.","{'answer_start': [2143], 'text': ['the maxillary and mandibular first molars emerge in the mouth at 6 or 7 years of age']}",,growth,"{'authors': ['Eiji Tanaka', 'Aki Kawazoe', 'Saika Nakamura', 'Goshi Ito', 'Naoto Hirose', 'Yuki Tanne', 'Nobuhiko Kawai', 'Kotaro Tanimoto', 'Kazuo Tanne'], 'doi': 'https://doi.org/10.2319/121007-581.1', 'meta': 'Angle Orthod (2008) 78 (6): 1110–1118.', 'title': 'An Adolescent Patient with Multiple Impacted Teeth'}",e02f5bba-ff70-4cc3-9df4-5f749f44a2bf
"regarding the biomechanics of moments, how tooth movement results from the moment of a single force?","the essence of activating a 2x4 appliance is the creation and control of moments and their equilibrium forces. moments are created by only two mechanisms i) a single force acting away from the center of resistance or, ii) a pair of forces or couple. the moment of a single force results from a point force acting on a tooth away from the center of resistance, causing the tooth to rotate around a center of rotation which is apical to the center of resistance. the moment of a couple results from a couple at the bracket (figure 1) and causes rotation around the center of resistance of the tooth. any single force, including a net equilibrium force resulting from a moment, causes translation of the tooth if applied through the center of resistance of the tooth. since it is rarely possible to apply forces through the center of resistance, forces usually create a moment of the force. this kind of moment is measured by the magnitude of the force times the perpendicular distance from the line of the force to the center of resistance. the moment of the force is varied simply by altering the point of application of the force and is not an inherent property of the equilibrium of a given system as is the moment of the couple. the moment of a couple at any bracket is potentially derived from several components. when a wire is not yet inserted into the brackets and is positioned over two equal sized adjacent brackets, the greater the angle of entry of the wire into the bracket, the greater the moment of the couple at that this angle of entry is affected by preactivation bends in the wire and/or the position of result of tooth malposition or bracket bonding error. since this component of the moment of the couple is determined by the passive wire/bracket slot angulation before the deformation of the wire that results from its placement in the bracket slot, this is termed the passive component of the moment of the couple. in addition, when a wire of any given stiffness is inserted into a bracket slot, deformation of the wire occurs which also contributes to the moment of the couple. this component of the moment of the couple, resulting from deformation of the wire itself, is termed the active component of the moment of the couple. the active component of the moment of a couple naturally decreases as tooth movement occurs with progressive deactivation of the wire.","{'answer_start': [381], 'text': ['rotate around a center of rotation which is apical to the center of resistance']}",,biomechanics,"{'authors': ['Robert J.

"in subjects where vertical growth of the mandible exceeds horizontal growth, what happens to the mandibular plane?","what are these vertical elements of growth? specifically where are the increments which produce an increase in facial height? they are as follows: (fig. 3) (1) growth at nasion and in the corpus of the maxilla which produces an increase in the distance from nasion to anterior nasal spine and causes the maxillary molars and posterior nasal spine to move away from the sella-nasion plane, (2) growth of the maxillary posterior alveolar processes causing the molar teeth to move away from the palatal plane, and (3) growth at the mandibular posterior alveolar processes causing the molar teeth to move occlusally. the vertical growth of the anterior alveolar processes does not seem to have an appreciable effect on facial height. it is merely expressed in varying degrees of overbite. the dorsal migration of the glenoid fossa is a very real factor in many cases and tends to cancel out the growth of the condyles; thus, in a sense it is arrayed on the side of vertical growth. surface additions of bone at pogonion usually have an insignificant effect, but occasionally we do see quite appreciable apposition in this area, clockwise rotation of the mandible is a result of more posterior vertical growth than condylar growth, the point of rotation being the condyles. we know that when vertical growth exceeds horizontal growth, (condylar growth) pogonion cannot keep pace with the forward growth of the upper face and the mandibular plane must become steeper (fig. 2). what effect does this type of growth have upon treatment? obviously this condition would not help reduce the anb angle, and it would not aid in correction of a class ii molar relation. however, it would tend to help correct the vertical overbite of the incisors. many such growth patterns actually do reduce the vertical overbite, perhaps the majority do not. there is ample evidence to show that dominance of vertical growth of the face facilitates the correction and retention of vertical overbite.","{'answer_start': [1420], 'text': ['the mandibular plane must become steeper']}",,growth,"{'authors': ['F.

"regarding enamel white spot lesions (wsl), which treatments are recommended to manage these lesions?","orthodontic appliances lead to the accumulation of dental plaque by creating new retention areas. they also complicate oral hygiene procedures and increase the risk of formations of white spot lesions (wsls). however, wsls can also be seen in orthodontically untreated individuals. gorelick et al. found that the incidence of white spot formation in patients treated with fixed orthodontic appliances was nearly 50% compared to 24% in an untreated control group. recently, lucchese and gherlone found wsls in 13% of orthodontically untreated patients. furthermore, some orthodontic appliances (functional appliances, rapid maxillary expansion appliances, etc.) can lead to the formation of wsls during the initial phase of orthodontic treatment. therefore, the clinician may need to give additional attention to the bonding phase of orthodontic brackets in such patients and could help these patients by improving the wsls with several remineralization procedures before fixed orthodontic treatment. overall, different remineralization procedures have been recommended for the management of wsls. wsls can be managed with fluoride and casein phosphopeptide amorphous calcium phosphate (cpp-acp) applications, enamel microabrasion, and bleaching. fluoride provides remineralization of early enamel lesions and slows the progress of the carious process by forming flourapatite. if adequate amounts of salivary or plaque calcium and phosphate ions are available, the remineralization of previously demineralized enamel can be promoted by fluoride ions. cpp-acp, which is derived from milk casein, can also be used for remineralization. it has been shown that cpp-acp increases the levels of calcium and phosphate ions significantly in supragingival plaque and promotes the remineralization of enamel subsurface lesions in situ. another remineralization procedure is microabrasion, and it has been extensively used to remove superficial noncarious enamel defects. microabrasion abrades the enamel surface and leaves a highly polished surface with calcium phosphate packed into the interprismatic area. this surface is less susceptible to bacterial colonization and demineralization than natural enamel. recently, a new approach called resin infiltration has been used for noncavitated lesions. in this method, the pore system of a noncavitated white spot is filled or reinforced with a light-curable resin.","{'answer_start': [1122], 'text': ['fluoride and casein phosphopeptide amorphous calcium phosphate (cpp-acp) applications, enamel microabrasion, and bleaching']}",,clinical,"{'authors': ['Zeliha Müge Baka', 'Mehmet Akin', 'Zehra Ileri', 'Faruk Ayhan Basciftci'], 'doi': 'https://doi.org/10.2319/041515-247.1', 'meta': 'Angle Orthod (2016) 86 (4): 661–667.', 'title': 'Effects of remineralization procedures on shear bond strengths of brackets bonded to demineralized enamel surfaces with self-etch systems'}",b3cb01a9-c901-4e95-af6d-a3791a324f84
"regarding friction during sliding mechanics, how do self-ligating brackets compare to elastomerically tied brackets?","the specific objective of minimizing friction within sliding mechanics has contributed to the recent reintroduction of self-ligating bracket systems to mainstream orthodontics. it is claimed that these newer brackets reduce wire-slot friction, improve oral hygiene, lessen anchorage loss, and shorten chair and treatment time. studies have reported that self-ligating brackets generate less sliding friction than elastomerically tied brackets. in general, self-ligating brackets fall into one of two design categories, based on the manner of slot closure. the typical active bracket features a resilient spring clip that snaps closed into the slot, reducing its faciolingual depth. because this clip can store energy when it is activated by a lingual malalignment, a rotated tooth, or a twisted rectangular wire, it has the potential to exert lingual force on the wire and help bring the tooth into its proper position. critics of the clip design say, however, that an active component of the ligation unnecessarily increases frictional resistance. some investigators have found that any advantage from decreased friction with active self-ligating brackets is reduced when rectangular wires are placed. suggested also is that the asymmetric design of the cantilevered clip delivers a diagonally directed force to the archwire, in effect reducing torque efficiency and causing errors in torque expression. passive ligating mechanisms do not compromise the depth of the slot. one passive design uses a door that slides across the slot, effectively transforming the bracket into a tube. another design features a c-clip lateral to each of the mesial and distal tie wings. the claimed benefit of passive self-ligating systems is reduced friction with all archwire sizes, resulting in faster tooth movement. with the absence of a lingually directed force against it, however, some critics argue that the inability to control torque could be a problem with less than full-sized (rectangular) wires.","{'answer_start': [354], 'text': ['self-ligating brackets generate less sliding friction than elastomerically tied brackets']}",,materials,"{'authors': ['Michael Chung', 'Robert J.

"regarding smile width, what is the preference of laypersons?","the mouth and teeth are considered fundamental in facial esthetics. the attractiveness of smiles has been evaluated in modern orthodontics. three aspects of smile esthetics have recently received great attention: the amount of gingival display, the presence of the smile arc, and buccal corridor spaces. a smile demonstrating minimal gingival display has been considered to be more esthetic than a smile with excessive gingival display. the smile arc is defined as the relationship of the curvature of the incisal edges of the maxillary incisors and canines to the curvature of the lower lip in the posed smile.6 the smile arc is considered ideal when the maxillary incisal edge curvature is parallel to the curvature of the lower lip. another important smile aspect is the presence or absence of buccal corridors. frush and fisher defined the buccal corridor as the spaces between the facial surfaces of the posterior teeth and the corners of the lips when the patient is smiling. they considered that the presence of the buccal corridor was important to attempt to fabricate a more natural-looking denture. they believed that a very broad denture gave the patient an unnatural denture appearance. at the present time, however, because more people are living longer and preserving their natural teeth, the perception of pleasing smile esthetics might be changing. in fact, when laypersons were shown full-face color photographs with five alterations in the buccal corridors, they preferred faces with minimal buccal corridor spaces. specifically, laypersons significantly preferred broader smiles to narrow smiles. to date, there has been no report evaluating the effects of buccal corridors on smile esthetics in the japanese population. the purpose of this study was to test the hypothesis that the amount of the buccal corridor has no influence on smile evaluations of japanese orthodontists and dental students","{'answer_start': [1548], 'text': ['laypersons significantly preferred broader smiles to narrow smiles']}",,clinical,"{'authors': ['Hideki Ioi', 'Shunsuke Nakata', 'Amy L.

what is the effect on a transpalatal bar on anchorage?,"transpalatal bars are routinely used in orthodontics in both permanent and mixed dentition treatments to establish and maintain arch widths, to derotate unilaterally or bilaterally rotated molars, to control upper molar eruption, to increase posterior anchorage, to correct unilateral crossbites, for maxillary expansion and buccal root torque of upper molars, and to correct mesiodistal asymmetries. different designs of transpalatal arches exist. the original and still most commonly used transpalatal bar designed by goshgarian (goshgarian-type transpalatal bar [gtpb]) is bent from a 0.036-inch (0.9 mm) stainless steel wire with or without a central loop. the loop is oriented either mesially or distally. the traditional form can be bent directly by the clinician or used prefabricated in different lengths (gac international inc, central islip, ny). these bars are most commonly used with prefabricated lingual attachments welded to the molar bands or soldered directly onto the bands. variations of the traditional transpalatal bar are the quad-helix appliance, burstone's precision lingual arches with hinge cap attachment, wilson 3d lingual appliances, niti palatal expander, and niti molar rotator. a recently introduced design variation is the zachrisson-type transpalatal bar (ztpb). the clinical application of the ztpb appears satisfactory, but the forces and moments produced have not been assessed. the aim of this study was to measure the forces and moments produced by the ztpb using a computer-based strain gauge system and to compare these forces and moments with those of the gtpb.","{'answer_start': [233], 'text': ['increase posterior anchorage']}",,clinical,"{'authors': ['Elif Gündüz, DDS', 'Bjorn U.

"in nonsyndromic cleft subjects, which genes influence are associated with tooth agenesis?","because development of the oral cleft and formation of the tooth germ are closely related in terms of timing and anatomic position, dental anomalies including tooth agenesis both within and outside the cleft area have been reported to be more frequent in persons with nonsyndromic cleft lip with or without cleft palate (ns-cl +- p) than in individuals with nonsyndromic cleft lip with or without cleft palate (ns-cl +- p) than in the non-cleft individuals. tooth agenesis in cleft patients affects esthetics, function, and periodontal health; causes collapse of the dental arch; and creates psychosocial problems. therefore, an interdisciplinary approach is required to allow patients to receive more effective and efficient treatment. the msx1 and pax9 genes are known to contribute to tooth agenesis of the posterior teeth and the maxillary lateral incisor. the msx1 genes with a homeodomain and the pax9 genes with a paired domain encode transcription factors that are essential for craniofacial and dental development of the mesenchyme. generally, mutations in msx1 and pax9 cause loss of function because of haploinsufficiency and reduce the amount of functional protein available to maintain tooth development; this results in abnormalities in odontogenesis, such as arrest of the tooth bud. to date, only a few studies have addressed the genetic basis of oral cleft with or without tooth agenesis in humans. van den boogaard et al. and liang et al. suggested that tooth agenesis and oral cleft were associated with nonsense mutations of msx1, such as ser104stop in exon 1 in a dutch family and q189x in exon 2 in a chinese family, respectively. however, liang et al. also reported that sequence analysis of pax9 did not reveal mutation in any of the affected individuals studied. modesto et al. investigated single-nucleotide polymorphisms (snps) in msx1 of cl p with or without tooth agenesis compared with non-cleft individuals and reported that the 101c>g variant occurred more frequently in patients with both ns-cl p and tooth agenesis, whereas the *6c>t variant was found more often in those with ns-cl p. however, these studies have several limitations, such as small sample size, inclusion of non-cleft individuals, or no classification of tooth agenesis within and outside the cleft area.","{'answer_start': [737], 'text': ['the msx1 and pax9 genes']}",,pathology,"{'authors': ['Yu-Jin Seo', 'Ji Wan Park', 'Young Ho Kim', 'Seung-Hak Baek'], 'doi': 'https://doi.org/10.2319/020513-104.1', 'meta': 'Angle Orthod (2013) 83 (6): 1036–1042.', 'title': 'Associations between the risk of tooth agenesis and single-nucleotide polymorphisms of MSX1 and PAX9 genes in nonsyndromic cleft patients'}",cb0c5440-0d2e-473e-827f-2c738cea2615
"regarding maxillary impacted canines, what proportion of canines are labially impacted?","patients with impacted maxillary canines and significant resorption of the adjacent lateral incisors present the dental team with significant treatment challenges. to address these challenges effectively, it is helpful to review the literature on the etiology and incidence of both canine impaction and root resorption, especially resorption associated with impaction. treatment of a case with bilateral maxillary canine impaction and associated lateral incisor root resorption is reported. maxillary canine impaction occurs in approximately 1% to 2% of the population. females are affected approximately twice as often as males. approximately 80% to 90% of impacted canines are palatal and 10% to 20% are labial. the maxillary canine has the longest and most tortuous path of eruption, from its site of formation lateral to the piriform fossa to its final position in the arch. endocrine deficiencies, febrile diseases, and irradiation can cause general retardations in eruption, and thus can affect canine eruption. etiologic agents that may influence canines more specifically include lack of space, early loss or prolonged retention of the primary canine, abnormal position of the tooth bud, ankylosis, cystic or neoplastic formation, root dilaceration, and the iatrogenic repositioning of the adjacent lateral incisor into the canines path of eruption. palatal impactions have been associated with the absence of roots or variations in the root size of the associated maxillary lateral incisor. a genetic origin for the palatally displaced canine has also been proposed. dental crowding is more often associated with labial impactions than with palatal impactions. root resorption has been found to occur in 80% to 100% of adults, even those who have not received orthodontic treatment. orthodontic treatment is one well-documented factor in root resorption, and resorption during treatment is more likely if the teeth already show some evidence of resorption. fortunately, the resorption that is related to orthodontic treatment almost never progresses after the orthodontic forces are discontinued.","{'answer_start': [691], 'text': ['10% to 20% are labial']}",,pathology,"{'authors': ['W.

"regarding three dimensional analysis, what is the yaw?","mandibular prognathism is highly prevalent in asians and is usually accompanied by facial asymmetry. when skeletal disharmony is present, the dentition migrates not only anteroposteriorly and vertically but also transversely to achieve occlusal function. for patients with facial asymmetry, accurate diagnosis and surgical treatment planning and adequate removal of transverse dental compensations in the maxillary and mandibular arches is a requisite for successful management of facial asymmetry. traditionally, two-dimensional (2d) cephalometric radiographs, such as posteroanterior (pa) cephalograms and submentovertex radiographs, have been essential tools for evaluating facial asymmetry. in 2003, kusayama et al. showed a high correlation between skeletal asymmetry and dental compensation by analyzing pa radiographs and three-dimensional (3d) dental models. shigefuji et al. also reported greater molar axis changes in the deviated side than in the nondeviated side. previous studies revealed several characteristics of transverse dental compensations and their relationship with skeletal facial asymmetry but failed to quantify the severity of deviation due to the lack of a control group. in addition, 2d modalities face limitations caused by image magnification, distortion, and superimposition of skeletal structures. when using pa images, it is easy to overestimate or underestimate the severity of facial asymmetry. gateno et al. described significant distortion of the shape and size of the mandible in roll and yaw asymmetries. currently, diagnosis and treatment planning of facial asymmetry can be performed through quantitative measurement of 3d cone-beam computed tomography (cbct) images. mandibular asymmetry should be described three-dimensionally using three angles: pitch, roll, and yaw. pitch refers to the rotation of the object around the transverse axis, roll refers to the rotation of the object around the anteroposterior axis, and yaw refers to the rotation of the object around the vertical axis. however, there has been a lack of 3d classification of mandibular asymmetry as well as evaluations on transverse dental compensation in patients with asymmetry. the purpose of this study was to evaluate the characteristic transverse dental compensations in patients with facial asymmetry and mandibular prognathism and to compare features of dental compensations between two types of mandibular asymmetry using 3d cbct.","{'answer_start': [1963], 'text': ['yaw refers to the rotation of the object around the vertical axis']}",,anatomy,"{'authors': ['Svetlana Tyan *', 'Hong-Sik Park *', 'Munkhshur Janchivdorj', 'Sun-Ho Han', 'Su-Jung Kim', 'Hyo-Won Ahn'], 'doi': 'https://doi.org/10.2319/030915-142.1', 'meta': 'Angle Orthod (2016) 86 (3): 421–430.', 'title': 'Three-dimensional analysis of molar compensation in patients with facial asymmetry and mandibular prognathism'}",3423ea16-4dd1-41c9-897b-a991093b887d
"regarding subjects in mixed dentition, what is the prevalence of failure of eruption of a permanent incisor?","failure of eruption of permanent upper incisors is an infrequent observation in dental practice, but its treatment is essential because of the keen importance of these teeth in the smile's esthetics. this pathologic condition of the early mixed dentition phase occurs in 0.2% to 1.0% of the population. supernumerary teeth and odontomas are the most common cause of failure of eruption. other factors that can lead to the failure of maxillary incisors eruption are dilacerated teeth, tooth malposition, abnormal inclination and crowding, persistent primary maxillary incisors, trauma leading to dilacerations and developmental displacement, dense mucoperisteum, follicular cysts, and nonvital primary teeth. during normal eruption, the two permanent central incisors emerge within the arch almost concomitantly. in the presence of only one fully erupted central incisor, the practitioner should examine the potential causes of the contralateral incisor's delayed eruption. early diagnosis is very important, and interceptive orthodontic treatment could not only improve skeletal relationship and eliminate functional interferences but also may correct disturbances during the eruption. geometric morphometrics has been proposed in the literature as an original method of visualization of shape changes. it can show three-dimensional (3d) morphological changes in their complexity, in a more effective way than traditional bidimensional measurements used for morphometric analyses. geometric morphometrics is also used to address an increasingly varied range of questions about evolution and development of organisms.","{'answer_start': [271], 'text': ['0.2% to 1.0% of the population']}",,pathology,"{'authors': ['Chiara Pavoni', 'Valeria Paoloni', 'Luis Tomas Huanca Ghislanzoni', 'Giuseppina Laganà', 'Paola Cozza'], 'doi': 'https://doi.org/10.2319/071716-557.1', 'meta': 'Angle Orthod (2017) 87 (3): 404–408.', 'title': 'Geometric morphometric analysis of the palatal morphology in children with impacted incisors: A three-dimensional evaluation'}",d0c3570c-194a-4998-b5be-37c6f0120a73

"in patients with cleft lip and/or palate (cl/p), what is the difference in permanent tooth formation in cl/p subjects compared to the unaffected population?","cleft lip and/or palate (cl/p) is one of the most common craniofacial deformities in humans. some dental abnormalities, including hypodontia, supernumerary tooth, delay in tooth formation, and asymmetric tooth formation have been reported in patients with cl/p. previous studies suggested that the formation of permanent tooth was delayed from 0.3 to 0.9 years in patients with cl/p compared with healthy populations, and that an asymmetrical pattern of tooth formation was observed in patients with unilateral cl/p. several etiologic factors, including maternal or genetic influences, growth retardation due to nutritional deficits, lack of space in the hypoplastic quadrant of the maxilla on the cleft side, and surgical procedures might influence the occurrence of these dental abnormalities in patients with cleft. alveolar bone graft (abg) has become a critical procedure in the overall management of patients with cl/p. the purposes of abg are to fill the bony gap, to stabilize the overall dental arch, to provide bony support for the teeth adjacent to the cleft area, to close the residual oronasal fistula, and to support the lip and nose. although a number of protocols for abg have been suggested according to donor site and surgical timing, secondary abg with particulate cancellous bone and marrow from the iliac bone is the most acceptable procedure to provide periodontal support for the permanent teeth adjacent to the cleft and spontaneous migration of the permanent maxillary canine (mxc) into the graft area. although the tooth development stage may be the same in subjects with similar ages, it may differ according to gender, ethnic group, and cleft severity. because previous studies did not use subjects from the same ethnic background and with the same age range, gender, cleft severity, bone graft technique, or orthodontic treatment protocol, it has been difficult to obtain consistent and objective outcomes. in addition, although several previous studies have reported delays in tooth development in children with cl/p and differences in the eruption pattern of the permanent mxc after secondary abg (sabg), they did not analyze the relationship between sabg and tooth development stage. therefore, further study is needed using subjects with the same ethnic background and gender and similar ages. in addition, because bilateral cl/p makes it difficult to compare tooth development stage, unilateral cl/p is preferred for investigating differences in tooth development stage before and after sabg.","{'answer_start': [294], 'text': ['the formation of permanent tooth was delayed from 0.3 to 0.9 years in patients with cl/p compared with healthy populations']}",,pathology,"{'authors': ['Heon-Mook Park', 'Dong-Hun Han', 'Seung-Hak Baek'], 'doi': 'https://doi.org/10.2319/011014-38.1', 'meta': 'Angle Orthod (2014) 84 (6): 989–994.', 'title': 'Comparison of tooth development stage of the maxillary anterior teeth before and after secondary alveolar bone graft: Unilateral cleft lip and alveolus vs unilateral cleft lip and palate'}",76af859c-97cf-4342-b8e9-55e6cba25b96
"in subjects with class ii division 2 malocclusion, how are the maxillary lateral incisors positioned generally?","class ii division 2 malocclusion is characterized by the permanent mandibular incisors occluding posterior to the cingulum plateau of retroclined permanent maxillary incisors. this gives rise to a reduced overjet and frequently an increased overbite. classically, the permanent maxillary central incisors are retroclined and the maxillary lateral incisors are proclined and mesiolabially rotated. however, all four permanent maxillary incisors may be retroclined with or without facially displaced and proclined permanent maxillary canines. the relationship of the labial soft tissues to the permanent maxillary incisors has been implicated as the principal etiological factor in the development and relapse of class ii division 2 malocclusion. specifically, the maxillary incisor retroclination is thought to result from increased resting lip pressure as a consequence of a combination of hyperactivity of the labial musculature and a higher resting lip line. despite cephalometric studies confirming the higher resting lip line, electromyographic studies have not confirmed unanimously increased labial musculature activity in subjects with class ii division 2 malocclusions when compared with those with class i malocclusion. furthermore, no previous study has investigated simultaneously lip shape and position as a factor in the development of class ii division 2 malocclusion. this is because shape data cannot be derived from linear and angular measurements. morphometric techniques overcome many of the limitations of conventional cephalometric measurements because they integrate geometric location and biologic homology allowing shape comparisons to be made. the objective of this study is to determine whether differences exist in the shape and position of the lips between class ii division 2 and class i malocclusions. the null hypothesis tested is that there are no differences in the shape and position of the lips between class ii division 2 and class 1 malocclusions.","{'answer_start': [325], 'text': ['the maxillary lateral incisors are proclined and mesiolabially rotated']}",,clinical,"{'authors': ['Grant T.

"for class ii patients, which functional appliance has causes the most flaring of mandibular incisors?","the twin block group demonstrated stability of the skeletal changes as exhibited through the decrease in the wits appraisal and the displacement of pogonion in a more anterior position. after appliance therapy, the anb angle decreased ( 0.6 per year), while the snb angle increased (0.9 per year) when compared with the controls. these findings are consistent with multiple studies, which noted the favorable changes in anb. patel et al noted forward movement of b-point and pogonion while baccetti et al found pogonion to move forward 2.5 mm per year with twin block therapy. the twin block group exhibited the best vertical control when compared with all treatment groups, especially taking into account that the mean sn-gogn angle was initially greater in this group at the outset. the twin block also showed clockwise rotation of the occlusal plane after phase ii therapy and the most flaring of the mandibular incisors at the end of treatment. these findings could be explained by the bite block effect of the appliance on the buccal segments and pressure of the lingual acrylic on the lower incisors. possibly, this side effect could have been prevented using a labial bow to support the lower anteriors as designed by mcnamara and brudon. mills and mcculloch reported similar findings. the twin block appliance also decreased the overbite and overjet significantly over the long term when compared with the controls, showing the stability of the treatment effect. the mara group illustrated a combination of skeletal and dentoalveolar changes that were stable over time. the flaring of the maxillary and mandibular incisors was only temporary after phase i therapy and was resolved at the end of edgewise treatment. the decrease in sna could be due to the distal remodeling at a-point caused by the initial flaring of the upper incisors; therefore, it could not be solely attributed to restriction of maxillary growth. co-apt did not decrease over time. this finding contrasts with that of pangrazio-kulbersh et al who reported significant restriction of maxillary growth with mara treatment. remodeling at a-point, resulting in a decrease in sna, has been reported by mills and mcculloch and illing et al. the changes in co-apt did not correlate with the decrease in sna. posterior condylar growth expressed during mara treatment could have influenced the total maxillary length masking the true effect of the appliance on maxillary growth. the decrease in snb is most likely due to the increase in the vertical dimension, which was significant when compared with the controls. this vertical increase is most likely related to growth and changes in the occlusal plane.","{'answer_start': [0], 'text': ['the twin block']}",,clinical,"{'authors': ['Nicole J.

"regarding debonding, what can explain the high bond strength of ceramic brackets?","ceramic brackets, which are primarily of monocrystalline or polycrystalline sapphire, are esthetically more pleasing than their metal, coated metal and plastic predecessors. they also appear to have some superior bonding characteristics. however, there are some indications of reduced fracture toughness which may lead to uncontrolled bracket wing failure during function. while ceramic bracket bonding has been addressed to some extent, the relationship between bracket bonding behavior and different bonding systems still requires clarification. brackets are fabricated of stainless steel, plastic, and in recent years, ceramic. a wide variety of bracket types is available for clinical use. ongoing research and development continues to improve their properties. the shortcomings of plastic brackets in their present forms include moisture absorption, which progressively weakens the bond strength, discoloration and excessive distortion. while stainless steel attachments have none of the disadvantages of plastic attachments, they are less acceptable esthetically. ceramic brackets made of monocrystalline sapphire are more esthetically pleasing than either plastic or metal brackets. the material is more transparent than plastic and the color is more stable. ceramic brackets are also quite strong; they are more difficult to deform than plastic brackets and have a higher tensile strength than stainless steel. the bonding strength of ceramic brackets has been shown to be significantly higher than that of metal brackets. in fact, orthodontists sometimes experience problems during debonding when the bond is too strong to break. this high bond strength results from silanization of the bracket base, mechanical retention, or both. since these factors may act in combination to produce excessive bond strength, some consideration is being given to fabricating ceramic brackets that are retained only by micromechanical means. fractures occasionally occur at the bracket wings during orthodontic treatment and debonding; removal of these brackets may require use of a high-speed diamond bur a time-consuming procedure. bond failure may also occur at the resin-enamel interface, jeopardizing the integrity of the enamel surface of the bonded tooth. bond strength has been measured in a number of studies using a wide range of etching agents, and adhesives with metal and plastic brackets. todate, investigations regarding the shear bond strength of ceramic brackets have been limited, with the majority of the data reporting chemically-cured adhesive systems. the purpose of this investigation was to determine the shear and tensile bond strength of various ceramic and ceramic-filled brackets in combination with a variety of commonly used bonding systems.","{'answer_start': [1676], 'text': ['silanization of the bracket base, mechanical retention, or both']}",,materials,"{'authors': ['Spiro J.

"regarding treatment in mixed dentition, what is the effect of the lip bumper on arch perimeter?","the results of this study increased our understanding of mandibular dental arch dimensional changes and their short- and long-term stability among growing patients treated with the lip bumper followed by fixed appliances. analysis of the lip bumper effects in the mixed dentition followed by fixed appliances showed statistically and clinically significant increases in arch widths and decreases in crowding after an average 6.3-year follow-up. generally, the greatest arch width gain has been suggested to occur in the premolar area and the smallest either in the canine or the molar area. in contrast, expansion in the treated group was greater in the posterior area of the arch than in the anterior, with an increase of 3.0, 2.9, and 1.7 mm for molars, premolars, and canines, respectively, probably due to periodic bumper activation including expansion associated with molar derotation. crowding changes in the treated cases were significantly different from the decreases displayed in the controls. reduction in dental crowding, seen in the treated group, can be ascribed to increases in arch widths and not by the 0.2 incisor proclination reported, that was statistically and clinically irrelevant and less than what has been reported elsewhere. however, the crowding value could be overestimated because of the measurement used to calculate tooth-size/arch-length deficiency, that probably underestimated perimeter (straight segments not accounting for some on the anterior mandibular arch curvature). in agreement with previous studies, arch length decreased, indicating a probable mesial movement of the molars into the e-space. however, compared with controls, the arch length decrease was less than would be otherwise expected, indicating some preservation of the e-space. the decrease may be considered insignificant, in contrast to previous findings, which indicated an increase in arch length of 2.19 and 2.47 mm, respectively, using lip bumpers with acrylic shields. our study showed a decrease of 0.6 mm, indicating that our lip bumper treatment did not produce mandibular incisor proclination as a bumper with an acrylic shield might have. the observed decrease may reflect a positive treatment effect because greater mandibular arch length decreases are normally expected during the mixed dentition. the lip bumper increased mandibular perimeter as expected. in the treated group, the perimeter increase, statistically not significant, was 2.84 mm more closely related to arch width than to arch length changes, as previously reported. in contrast, davidovitch et al. attributed most increases in perimeter to incisor proclination and molar distalization. after the fixed appliances, no tendency to relapse was observed. arch widths continued to increase slightly, solving the residual crowding of 1.06 mm. only perimeter and arch length decreased because of space closure. moreover, in this sample, attempts were made, during fixed appliance treatment, to maintain the arch dimensions and form achieved after lip bumper treatment, to enhance stability because the arch form card used for bending archwires was derived from the dental cast after lip bumper treatment.","{'answer_start': [2318], 'text': ['the lip bumper increased mandibular perimeter as expected']}",,clinical,"{'authors': ['Gaetana Raucci', 'Camila Pachêco-Pereira', 'Maryam Elyasi', 'Fabrizia d’Apuzzo', 'Carlos Flores-Mir', 'Letizia Perillo'], 'doi': 'https://doi.org/10.2319/073015-519.1', 'meta': 'Angle Orthod (2016) 86 (5): 753–760.', 'title': 'Short- and long-term evaluation of mandibular dental arch dimensional changes in patients treated with a lip bumper during mixed dentition followed by fixed appliances'}",84d0b283-50bf-404b-bff0-00602143eab4
"appart from thermoelastic transformation, how can nickel-titanium (niti) wires transform from austenetic to martensitic?","many studies have investigated the characteristics of the t-loop design, usually made from titanium molybdenum alloy (tma), but to date very little has been published on t-loops made from nickel-titanium (niti). these wire alloys have the advantages of a shape-memory effect combined with superelasticity, together with excellent corrosion resistance and biocompatibility. initial studies by kum et al have shown that non-preactivated t-closing loops made of niti failed to achieve an optimum m:f for bodily tooth translation, with average values below 6:1. this was improved by adding preactivation bends into the niti t-loops, with m:f values greater than 10:1 being achieved. it is well documented that niti wires are temperature sensitive, with smaller forces produced at lower temperatures. this is due to the change in the crystal structure from the austenitic to the martensitic form as the temperature is decreased and is known as thermoelastic martensitic transformation. austenitic to martensitic transformation can also occur as a result of stress application, otherwise known as stress-induced martensitic (sim). there is thus a strong interrelationship between temperature and stress, and, as stated by meling and odegaard, a decrease in temperature is equivalent to an increase in stress. there is evidence that the effect of short-term temperature change on the bending stiffness of super-elastic niti wires is dependent on whether the wire is in the activation or deactivation phase. the deactivation phase is of clinical interest, and it appears that a transient drop in temperature has less enduring influence on the force produced than a transient rise in temperature, where the effect is longer lasting. intraoral temperature can fluctuate quite markedly, with values between 5 c and 58 c being recorded in the region of the upper incisor teeth, although, on average, the median temperature fluctuates between 33 c and 37 c for approximately 80% of the time.","{'answer_start': [1052], 'text': ['stress application, otherwise known as stress-induced martensitic (sim)']}",,materials,"{'authors': ['Yeen Lim', 'Andrew Quick', 'Michael Swain', 'Peter Herbison'], 'doi': 'https://doi.org/10.2319/092707-460.1', 'meta': 'Angle Orthod (2008) 78 (6): 1035–1042.', 'title': 'Temperature Effects on the Forces, Moments and Moment to Force Ratio of Nickel-Titanium and TMA Symmetrical T-loops'}",b198095d-693a-4f78-aa25-ad5ed24a5880
"regarding the distal jet appliance, which components are used to generate the distal force?","the sample for this retrospective analysis of the distal jet molar distalizing appliance consisted of 20 consecutively treated class ii orthodontic patients (11 females; nine males) obtained from the private practice of two clinicians. the mean age of the sample at the time of the initial records was 12.6 (sd 2.3). the criteria for subject selection included need for nonextraction treatment (ie, mild to moderate crowding); molar distalization achieved only with the distal jet in the first phase of treatment; availability of good quality radiographs and dental models (before treatment and after distalization). the 20 consecutively treated cases included nine subjects with maxillary second molars not yet emerged into the oral cavity. the second molars were partly erupted in five subjects and completely erupted in the remaining six subjects. no attachments were placed on any second molars during distalization and, therefore, the effects of second molar position on molar distalization could be isolated and examined. the distal jets used in this study were constructed with two bilateral tubes embedded in a modified acrylic nance palatal button according to the recommendations of the inventors of the distal jet (figure 1). the position of these tubes is critical for proper functioning and will be discussed later. the nance buttons were anchored by supporting wires to the first premolars. a bayonet wire was inserted into the lingual sheath of each first molar band and the free end was inserted into the tubes, much like a piston. a nickel-titanium open-coil spring and an activation collar (ie, screw clamp) were placed on each tube. compressing the coil spring generated a distally directed force. the activation collar was retracted and the mesial setscrew in each collar was locked onto the tube to maintain the force.","{'answer_start': [1548], 'text': ['a nickel-titanium open-coil spring and an activation collar (ie, screw clamp)']}",,clinical,"{'authors': ['Eugenio Bolla, Dr Odont, Spec Orthod', 'Filippo Muratore, Dr Odont, Spec Orthod', 'Aldo Carano, Dr Odont, MS, Spec Orthod', 'S.
